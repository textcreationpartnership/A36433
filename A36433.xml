            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' all my Services and Reſpects neceſſarily devolve on you, as on the Inheriter of your Brothers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, yet you may lay a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Claim to my Eſteem and Obſervance, from your own repeated Favours and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: In ſo much that I am bound by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tye of Gratitude, on all Occaſions, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my Reſentments of them, and think my ſelf unworthy privately to enjoy the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, unleſs I declare to the World how much I am Oblig'd to you. You must needs,
<pb facs="tcp:46662:3"/>Sir, think me ſincere in my Intentions, when, upon making ſo ſmall and inſigniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant a Payment, I am willing to call the Publick to witneſs, I am infinitely ſtill your Debtor. I confeſs the opportunity I have had of improving my Talent by the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your Brothers Tuition and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, might (you may juſtly think) have inabled me to offer you an Original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Tranſlation, and the Tranſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Character and Senſe, might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been expected than my Authors. But for my Apology, I muſt plead my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs in the loſs of him, which yet is no more peculiar to me than to the whole Society of <hi>Magdalen-College,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was a Member. He is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred as a Perſon in whom the Scholar and Gentleman were ſo well met, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſpoil'd the other: He was Learn'd without Arrogance; Genteel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vanity; Witty without Affectation; Well bred, Airy, Gay and Eaſy, yet never relax'd his Mind ſo far as to abate in any part of its real Improvement. And, though to inſtance the Graces and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Endowments of his Body, would be thought perhaps to derogate from thoſe of his Mind, and to make the Luſtre of his Vertues ſtand indebted to his Perſon, yet I can not but think ſo curious an Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:46662:3"/>was deſign'd to anſwer the Merit of the Inhabitant, whoſe outward Structure ſhould repreſent the Quality of the Owner. But I do not mean to inlarge on his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, for that is Work that muſt be wrought extreamly Fine, or methinks 'tis Nauſeous, even on the Dead; and, whatever I may pretend to the contrary, will look more like a Complement to your ſelf, than Juſtice to his Memory. The little I have ſaid will ſuffice, I hope, to ſhew that what I here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you is not altogether unſuitable to his or your Genius, wherein Philoſophy is diveſted of the Stiffneſs and Moroſneſs of the Schools, and has aſſum'd the Garb and Air of a more Ingenuous Education than ordinary. Here is ſomething, Sir, that will entertain your Philoſophical Minutes, and ſomething that will quicken thoſe deſign'd for your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; and all ſo mixt and temper'd, that the Author ſeems ſtill to have kept his Eye on thoſe two main ends, Pleaſing and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing. Philoſophy by this Method is become <hi>a la mode</hi> amongſt the Women of greateſt Quality in <hi>France,</hi> who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more in being accounted Partiſans of a Sect, than Leaders in Dreſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. And we may preſume that the Power and Force of Imitation will reach the Minds of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, when Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be ſet off with the Allurements
<pb facs="tcp:46662:4"/>and Delight they meet with in reading a Romance. To provoke them therefore I have adventur'd upon this Tranſlation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Prohibition of <hi>French</hi> Commodities: But it is not from their Judgments I expect the Approbation of my Endeavours: My chief Deſign was to pleaſe you; And if I ſhall in the leaſt ſucceed in that Attempt, it will be abundant Honour and Satisfaction to</p>

               <hi>ADVERTISEMENT</hi> OF THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>IT is almoſt three years ſince this Book was in a capacity of appearing; and if it were of any Concern to convince the World of this, it might be done by the Teſtimony of Perſons unſuſpected in this Affair; and ſuch as would merit Credit when they determin'd it in favour of the Author. The Reader may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in two or three places, that have ſome reference to thoſe times, which were not thought neceſſary to be alter'd. Such is the War betwixt <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Malebranche</hi> Father of the Oratory, of which there is an account given, without any mention of the Ceſſation of Arms, or any pretence of a Truce which hath been ſince concluded. But it may be preſum'd not amiſs, to adviſe ſuch as think themſelves not obligd to ſo exact an Inquiry into things of that Nature, that the Map of the Moon, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:46662:5"/>Hemiſphere is deſcrib'd at large in the Voyage to the World of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> is no new thing, and that <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Gaſſendus, Merſennus,</hi> &amp;c. are not Inhabitants of thoſe Lands and Countries lately diſcover'd in that vaſt Continent, nor, of thoſe wherewith the Author of this Book hath inlarg'd the Map. Our Aſtronomers have been acquainted with thoſe places long ago, and have eſtabliſh'd Principalities on behalf of thoſe great Men whoſe Names they bear. This may be ſeen in the <hi>Almageſtus</hi> of <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Mathematicians, who write Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Eclipſes of the Moon.</p>
            <p>Some may be farther inquiſitive to demand, why <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> had the Honour to be made <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Partner, in the framing of his World, rather than ſo many other famous <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians</hi> he might have made choiſe of. To which I return, that <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> had the Preference, not only on the account of the particular Eſteem and Love <hi>Carteſius,</hi> as well as other excellent Philoſophers of his time, had for him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the almoſt only Gentleman that was in a condition to be an Aſſiſtant in that great Enterprize when he began it; the other Ingenious <hi>Carteſians</hi> having not left our World till after him.</p>

            <head>A General View Of the whole WORK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LUCIAN,</hi> in his Entry upon his true Hiſtory, hath taken the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Method that poſſibly could be thought on. He proclaims forthwith to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that whatever he ſhall ſay is falſe. After which giving his Imagination ſwing, he loads the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with all the Extravagancies his Fancy can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with. By this means he ſecures himſelf from that grand Concern which attends all ſorts of Compoſition, and conſiſts in preſerving probability in the Narration; an Obligation otherwiſe indiſpenſable to every Writer that pretends to give Relations. The worſt of that <hi>Exordium</hi> is, it cannot be made uſe of twice, and that it begins to be Thred-bare, as
<pb facs="tcp:46662:6"/>ſoon as it ceaſes to be intirely new. It is a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Publick would never pardon in any one but him that had the good fortune firſt to light upon it: A gentile turn that no one can imitate without paſſing for a Plagiary, and a Grace of Wit that admits of nothing ſurprizing or agreeable in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Indeavour. That Conſideration joyn'd with the difficulty which may be eaſily gueſs'd, I had to preſerve the ſtrict Law of probability in my History, will perſuade thoſe that ſhall read it, that I envyed <hi>Lucian,</hi> more than once, this his ſo happy Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: Nor can I but acknowledge the ſame. Yet I muſt add, that a ſecond Conſideration would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably have determin'd me to a different Choice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though decency would have allow'd me to make uſe of the former. I am a Philoſopher: And the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I pretend to, bars all admittance unto ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. The Character of a Philoſpher is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſpeak Truth, or to think he does; at least indeavour to be thought to ſpeak it. For me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt my ſelf of all gayety of Humour, and then to affect it (to follow the Example of the greateſt Enemy the Philoſophers have known) would have been poorly to ſupport a Quality, I extreamly value my ſelf upon. So that I ſhould be cautious of uſing the like Preamble, and acquainting my Readers that all they were to expect of me ſhould be falſe. I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them therefore from this time forward that I have a quite contrary deſign, and that I mean to ſet off my Hiſtory with an Air of Truth, ſuch as may be able to perſuade the moſt Incredulous, did they layby Prejudice in the reading of it, that what I ſay is moſt undoubtedly true. But ſuch is the Nature of Prejudice and Prepoſſeſſion, that after all the pains I have taken to appear credible, I am conſcious
<pb facs="tcp:46662:6"/>notwithſtanding I ſhall not be believ'd. Let it be how it will: For after all I will by no means offer violence to the Judgment of my Readers. Now ſee in few Words the deſign of the Work.</p>
            <p>I therein relate the Particulars of a Voyage which I made to the World of <hi>Carteſius.</hi> I begin the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age very advantagiouſly, upon an occaſion that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune preſented me, and which ſeems worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Through the whole Thred of the Hiſtory, as I fall in with Emergencies, I explain with as little difficulty and as pleaſantly as the Subject will bear, the most principal Points of <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Philoſophy. I examine many of them in the way, and refute the greateſt part of them in a manner clear, as I think, and intelligible enough; and which commonly has in it ſomething new and unreceiv'd. I have made it my buſineſs to diverſify and enliven a Subject na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dry and melancholy, as well by the variety of Accidents, which give me occaſion to digreſs upon them, as by ſome peculiar and not incurious Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Hiſtory of <hi>Carteſianiſm:</hi> And likewiſe with ſome brisk and warm Diſcourſes of ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as no one will be uneaſy to hear Diſpute. To conclude, my laſt and moſt principal Buſineſs to the Examination and Diſcuſſion of the general Syſtem of <hi>Carteſius</hi> his World, and his managery of the chiefeſt Parts of it, as he propoſes it in his <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> and in that which is Intituled, <hi>A Treatiſe concerning Light,</hi> or the World of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> which he mentions ſo often in his Letters to <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> but was not printed till after his death. And I doubt not, in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, to eſtabliſh this one Propoſition, that hath been often advanc'd, but ſtill repuls'd, and still, I
<pb facs="tcp:46662:7"/>am confident, will be, as a Paradox to many, That there is ſcarce any Philoſophical Hypotheſis more unjust and incoherent, or whoſe Concluſions have leſs connexion with its Principles, than that of <hi>Carteſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Propoſition, I ſay, hath always ſeem'd a Paradox, becauſe it thwarts the generally receiv'd Opinion of that Philoſophy. No one will deny but that ſome of his Principles being but meer Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions without Proof, the Mind cannot find that ſatisfaction it demands: But what they ſtand upon is, That theſe Suppoſitions being once receiv'd, all the reſt doth follow in ſo direct a Line, in ſo great order and perſpicuity, that the evidence of the Conſqeuences, expanding it ſelf (as I may ſay) upon the Premiſes, the mind begins of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to imbrace for Truths, what were before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd as bare Suppoſitions.</p>
            <p>This may be true of ſome parts of his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and particularly of thoſe wherein he treats of the Nature of ſome Senſible Qualities, in which a Man must almoſt be forc'd to acquieſce, that ſhall read them without Prepoſſeſſion. But I am of opinion it is falſe in reſpect of the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of his World, and the Conſequences he draws from it. 'Tis this part of his Philoſophy which I ſhall more throughly examine, and it is this of all other, that hath hitherto best eſcap'd the Cenſure. Plenty of Objections have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> againſt the New De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, he hath pretended to give, for the exiſtence of a Deity, his diſtinction of the Soul and Body, his Syſtem of Light, his Rules of Motion,
<pb facs="tcp:46662:7"/>as alſo thoſe concerning Reflection and Refraction. Scarce any yet have given him diſturbance upon the Hypotheſis of his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> which is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Foundation of all he ſays touching the motion of the Planets, the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, the gravity and levity of Bodies; and of his whole System concerning Light, of which he himſelf has been ſo very fond.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay but they have augmented the Difficulties upon each of theſe laſt Heads, ſince a great many have attack'd him thereupon: But I only ſay they have ſeldom or never examin'd them with relation to his general Hypotheſis, by which I undertake to ſhew, that commonly what he writes of particular Matters, is inconſistent with the whole; and it is moſtly in that, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of my Voyage hath ſomething altogether new.</p>
            <p>For what remains, if I ſhall ſucceed in this last Affair, which was almoſt the only occaſion of this Enterprize, I ſhall glory to have been the most miſchievous Adverſary <hi>Carteſius</hi> ever met with. For that which diſtinguiſhes that great Man from all the other Philoſophers, is not the lucky Explication of ſome particular Phenomena's in Nature (that Praiſe is ſhar'd by an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Philoſophers, both Ancient and Modern) but that vastneſs of Capacity, and extent of Genius, whereby he could frame an intire Syſtem of the World, ſo well contriv'd, that taking for granted a few Principles most ſimple and eaſy to be underſtood, he could give a reaſon for all the Occurrencies of Nature. It is that Attempt, as
<pb facs="tcp:46662:8"/>moſt believe, by which he obtain'd his end, and which hath procur'd him ſo much Honour and Reputation. To ſhew then his Syſtem to be full of Contradictions, that it is incoherent, that one Suppoſition deſtroys another, is to undertake him in his strongest hold, and to wound him in the part that is most ſenſible. We ſhall ſee in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the History what ought to be our Thoughts of it.</p>

            <head>A VOYAGE TO <hi>The World of Carteſius.</hi> PART. I.</head>
            <p>IT fares with the <hi>World of Monſieur Deſcartes,</hi> as with other lately diſcovered Lands, whereof ſuch different Accounts are given, as often contradict one another. Scarce Mention was made of this <hi>New World,</hi> but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of <hi>French, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutchmen</hi> reſolve to go ſee it. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> however zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for new Diſcoveries, underſtanding it was barren of Mines of Gold and Silver, of Indigo and Ginger, ſeemed not much concerned about it: Wherefore thoſe that had moſt contributed unto it were not a little pleaſed, as believing, they had no Reaſon to apprehend the <hi>Inquiſition</hi>'s coming there to diſturb them. Among other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46662:10"/>Things in that World the <hi>Earth</hi> takes a Turn about the <hi>Sun,</hi> as in that of <hi>Copernicus:</hi> And it is known that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath more than once,<note place="margin">Deſc. tom. <hi>2.</hi> lett. <hi>43, 75.</hi>
               </note> on that occaſion, reflected on the Misfortune of poor <hi>Galileus.</hi> I cannot tell, but it may be on his Account he hath taken ſo much Pains to prove this Paradox,<note place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi> pr. n. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note> That the <hi>Earth</hi> ſtands ſtill, though at the ſame Time it is carried about the <hi>Sun</hi> by that Luminary's <hi>Vortex.</hi> Let it be how it will, many of thoſe that give out they have beſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that Country, have made their Relations of it, but ſo differently, that a Man can ſcarce yet determine what he muſt believe: If you will credit one Party, they'll tell you, It is no <hi>World</hi> at all, but a perfect <hi>Chaos:</hi> That all lie in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and wild Confuſion: That 'tis impoſſible for a Man to turn himſelf in it: That there is neither Light nor Colours, neither Heat nor Cold, Drought nor Moiſture: That Plants and Animals <hi>there</hi> don't live. There you have not only Liberty, but poſitive Orders to doubt of every thing in Nature. Some there ſhall be that will diſpute you out of the Name of a Man; though you have a Face like other Men; though you be made up of Fleſh and Bone as they; though you Walk, and Eat, and Sleep, and, in a Word, perform all the Natural Functions of a Man; yet, I ſay, there are thoſe that ſhall conteſt that Title with you, until having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed you, and underſtood you ſpeak <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially,</hi> they ſhall be convinced that you have <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> look Proud and Scornful, and have not the leaſt Reſpect for Antiquity. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> eſpecially is ſcouled in all Companies, and upon all Occaſions, by them, being look'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46662:10"/>upon as a Vain Babler, and an <hi>Antique</hi> Teller of Dreams. It is ſaid, There is neither good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> nor good <hi>Catholick</hi> there, ſince they tamper with Principles too Delicate and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in Matters relating to Religion. No Body can tell what to make of their Belief of the Creation of <hi>Our World,</hi> the Production of Matter and the Providence of God; who, with them, had no other Care upon him than to order the Cubical Particles of Matter to whirl about their Center: After which he might ſit Idle and Unconcerned, ſince all the reſt could be managed without the leaſt of his Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>On the other Side, we are aſſured, A moſt excellent Conduct ſhines through the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; That all is admirably contrived, and founded upon the Rules and Laws of Nature: That this <hi>World</hi> is indeed disburthened of an infinite Swarm of <hi>Accidents, Qualities,</hi> and <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Species,</hi> as of an unprofitable Lumber, wherewith the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have imbroiled and incumbred ours: But yet, notwithſtanding it cannot be deny'd, but the Senſes are ſubject to the ſame Impreſſions there as here, only with this Difference, that the Cauſes are more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and better explain'd.</p>
            <p>As to the Point of Religion, nothing ſeems more juſtifiable than the Apology of theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> which perhaps ſome have ingaged too inconſiderately for an Affair of that Weight and Moment. Can we apprehend a greater <hi>Idea</hi> of God Almighty, than that which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath given? An Idea that he derived not from the Viſible Creatures, that ſleight and faint Ray of an infinitely perfect Being; but which his Mind found impreſſed upon it ſelf, and which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46662:11"/>left no room for him to doubt of the Exiſtence of a Sovereign Being, though he poſſeſſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven nor Earth, nor any Body, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other Soul than <hi>his:</hi> Can the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Deity be advanced to a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Degree than he hath done it? God, according to him, can cauſe, That Two and Three ſhall not make Five; That four Sides ſhall not bé requiſite to make a Square; That the Whole ſhall be no bigger than One of its Parts; Effects that other <hi>Philoſophers</hi> never ſcruple to place out of the Reach of the God head. But has not an Author of a little Piece, called, <hi>A Letter wrote to a Learned Jeſuite,</hi> clearly ſhewn, That 'tis <hi>Deſcartes World</hi> that is deſcribed in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis?</hi> Another Book hath ſince been publiſh'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Cartèſius Moſaiſans,</hi> and is to the ſame effect. The Author of the Treatiſe concerning <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Stars,</hi> deſcribes the End of the World upon <hi>Deſcartes</hi> his Hypotheſis. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Scottanus,</hi> in a late Apology, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> againſt thoſe that Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render him obnoxious to the Suſpicion of Atheiſm, obſerves to us the Reſpect he had for Religion, certifying us, That one of his Reaſons for the reducing his Meditations to the Number of <hi>Six,</hi> was the Conſideration of the <hi>Six Days</hi> which God imployed in the Creation of the World. If we may credit <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus,</hi> a Learned and Noted <hi>Minim,</hi> and an intimate Acquaintance of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> we ſhall find nothing of a more Chriſtian Temper, and that inſpires us more raviſhingly with the Love of God than <hi>Deſcartes Philoſophy.</hi> In ſhort, there is nothing more edifying than the Letter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46662:11"/>that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> wrote to the <hi>Sorbon Doctors,</hi> in dedicating his <hi>Meditations</hi> to them; which is ſo true, that not long ſince, a Friend of mine, not wont to be very Nice in thoſe Matters, having read by chance the Letter at my Houſe, which touched him; and finding farther the Title of <hi>Meditations</hi> in the Front of the Work, he ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entreated me to lend him that Godly Book, to entertain his Devotions during <hi>Paſſion Week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſo ſtrange Variety of Opinions, and Relations counter to one another, of <hi>a World,</hi> otherwiſe of no little Renown, provoked my Curioſity, and induced me to be convinced of the Truth or Falſity of the Reports, in my own Perſon. All the Difficulty was to find a Guide to conduct me to a Country, to which there was no Road paſſable either for Horſe or Foot, for Coach or Barge, by Land or Sea: But preſently after my Reſolve, I was happily favoured with the moſt lucky Occaſion that could be wiſh'd, for the undertaking my Voyage with all the Pleaſure and Eaſe imaginable. Having ſojourned ſome Months in a Country Town, I ſtrook up Acquaintance with an <hi>Old Standard,</hi> of about eighty Years, a Man of Parts, and that formerly had converſed much with <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> That Commerce had begot in him an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Zeal for the Tenets of that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and exaſperated him to declaim againſt the Method and Opinions of the School, the Prejudices of Childhood, and taught him to make external Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies on the <hi>Carteſian Philoſophy.</hi> He had ſo given himſelf up to this Opinion, that he could no ways ſuffer, in Point of Philoſophy, any one to deviate never ſo little from it. In a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46662:12"/>that we had together upon ſuch ſort of Things, I deſired to know if he kept up his Correſpondence with any <hi>Carteſians</hi> of Worth and Reputation. No, (ſaid he) I have broke with all Sorts of Perſons that call themſelves by that Name. I can no longer find among them that Zeal and Obſervance the firſt <hi>Carteſians,</hi> without Reſerve attributed to that great Man. Every one now a days builds Syſtems according to his own Humor, and allows himſelf the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Adding or Retrenching what he pleaſes in the Platform <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath laid; which is a concern of that critical Nature as cannot be once touch'd without ſpoiling the whole. Since the Death of the Famous <hi>M. Cherſilier,</hi> I have forbore writing to any ſingle Perſon, for I am perſuaded, That the pure and unmixt <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> was buried with him.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen <hi>(reply'd I)</hi> are of a ſtrange Conſtitution. All the Prefaces of your Books are fill'd with Invectives and Raileries, againſt thoſe who implicitely eſpouſe the Sentiments of an Author, and profeſs they will never deſert him. It looks as if you, and the reſt of the new Philoſophers, had banded together in an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Confederacy, to make continual War upon the Followers of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> on that Account; and at the ſame time you fall into the ſame Error for which ye reproach them, and are an hundred times more bigotted to your <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> than they to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> For my part, I know not how to blame the Conduct of thoſe that are ſomewhat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which you are ſo enrag'd againſt. If their Reaſon hath diſcover'd to them another Path than what <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> trod in, why are you angry if they follow it? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> held Poſſeſſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46662:12"/>a long time, and reign'd abſolute Monarch in Philoſophy. The Preſcription and Vaſſalage of ſeveral Ages, confirm'd his Title of Prince of Philoſophers. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is a Rebel, who durſt encourage a Party againſt his Prince: What Right has he to demand a greater Submiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, than he was willing to allow to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>(anſwer'd he)</hi> Truth and Reaſon are manifeſtly on his ſide. That, reply'd I, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the firſt ſtep Rebellion ever makes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the juſtice of its Cauſe, and proclaim the publick Welfare does depend upon it. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Sir <hi>(purſu'd I)</hi> I am more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Neutrality in this Affair than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. I have determin'd to dive to the bottom of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Philoſophy, of which I have, as yet, but a dark and confus'd Knowledg, having never ſtudied him in his own Works, but in the Books of his Diſciples, as ſoon as they appear'd, and that irregularly, and without Method. But as I am oblig'd to leave this Country very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and have but a ſhort time to advantage my ſelf by your Ability in this Affair, therefore it was that I enquir'd, Whether you had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Letters, or Friendſhip with any good <hi>Carteſian</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to whoſe Acquaintance you might recommend me, and who would be willing to inſtruct a Scholar ſo apt and forward as I pretend to be?</p>
            <p>That Propoſal extreamly inſpirited my <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> and I perceiv'd a ſudden Joy diffus'd it ſelf all over his Countenance. Ever ſince I knew you (<hi>ſaid he,</hi> taking me by the Hand) I have obſerv'd in you a paſſionate Concern for Truth; which is the beſt, and firſt Diſpoſition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46662:13"/>
               <hi>Deſcartes</hi> requires to attain unto it. Trouble not your ſelf, you have ſtill two Months good, which you muſt ſtay with me; and that's as much time as is required. I ſhall in a little time receive ſome News from <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon wee'll take ſuch Meaſures as ſhall much ſhorten your Journey.</p>
            <p>Hey day! News from <hi>M. Deſcartes!</hi> (ſaid I) why he has been Dead this forty Years. I ſhould be ſorry, <hi>anſwer'd he,</hi> to have let that Word eſcape me in another's Preſence, but I let it ſlip purpoſely at preſent, to highten your Deſire of hearing from me thoſe Things which few in the World are acquainted with, which preſently will ſurprize you, and the Knowledg thereof will convey you in a trice to the end you deſire. Hear me then:</p>
            <p>You muſt know <hi>(continu'd he)</hi> that <hi>Carteſius,</hi> like the ancient Leaders of Sects of Philoſophers, avoided the publiſhing all the Myſteries of his Philoſophy. Some he reſerv'd, which he only divulg'd to ſome particular Friends, of which I had the good Fortune to be one. All the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Diſcoveries he had made, which he thought might be of Uſe, and either contribute to Morality, or ſerve to make any Progreſs in the Knowledg of Natural Beings, he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Publick with. But Prudence advis'd him to ſuppreſs ſuch others, as ſome might have converted to an evil Uſe. The Immortality of the Soul is one of thoſe Points, wherein he was oblig'd to obſerve that Method, and certainly is one of the moſt Important Articles in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. To prove this in a plain, familiar and intelligible way, ſuch as ſhall force the Mind to give aſſent, and leave not the leaſt Scruple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46662:13"/>is to undermine the chief Foundation of Libertiniſm and Atheiſm. This <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath done, by demonſtrating the diſtinction of the Soul and Body in a Man, by the only clear and diſtinct Conception that we have of thoſe two kinds of Being. That Demonſtration is one of the moſt fine and uſeful places of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Meditations. And he was high-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to ſee it ſo hotly oppos'd, eſpecially by <hi>Gaſſendus;</hi> which, though before he had ask'd his Permiſſion, gall'd and vex'd him, a little more perhaps than was convenient upon that occaſion. Which gave riſe to a Reflection in the Mouths of many at that time, and which betwixt our ſelves was true enough, <hi>That</hi> M. Deſcartes <hi>did not understand Raillery.</hi> But he had Moderation enough in the heat of his Conflict, to decline the ſubmitting to the Temptation, which had often invited him to confirm his Demonſtration by Experiment, fearing it might prove of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence: And that is the Myſtery which I am about to teach you.</p>
            <p>It was his way (as all know) to endeavour to make good by Experience, the Truths he had diſcover'd by the meer Light of his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was in hopes, that having demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo clear conviction the diſtinction of the Soul and Body, he might make ſo far a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs as to penetrate into the Secret of their Union, and at laſt come to that of ſeparating, and re-uniting them when he pleas'd. The Queſtions that his Illuſtrious Scholar, <hi>Elizabeth the Princeſs</hi> Palatine, us'd to make upon that Head, and the difficulty he found in himſelf to invent ſuch Solutions as might be eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, put him, in ſhort, upon the Undertaking.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46662:14"/>One day he propos'd his Deſign to me, and ſome other of his Friends. We thought him Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical: And I remember I laughing made Reply, That there was but one way imaginable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, which was, to find out the famous <hi>Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus of Mercury,</hi> which that God, they ſay, ſometimes by <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Orders made uſe of, to ſeparate the Souls from Bodies, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain term of Years to joyn them unto new ones, according to the Principles of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmigration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That however did not divert <hi>Carteſius</hi> from raving on his Project, not aſcertaining himſelf of the Succeſs, nor judging yet he ought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to deſpair. That was it, that ingag'd him in a more exact Study than formerly of an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, and occaſion'd him to make thoſe moſt exquiſite Diſcoveries in Anatomy. The firſt Concluſion that he drew from the Idea he had of the Soul, as of a being perfectly Indiviſible, was, That it was not extended through the whole Body, as vulgarly it is taught. He ſhew'd the falſity of that Maſter Reaſon, which was us'd till then to confirm Men in their Prejudices, that in whatever part you prick the Body the Soul is ſenſible of Pain. Then ſaid the Philoſophers, It muſt be extended through the whole. He expoſed the Weakneſs of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by two Experiments, that manifeſtly prove the perception of Pain, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Objects in Places where our Soul is not. The firſt is that of thoſe Perſons who have loſt an Arm, who from Time to Time perceive an Aking in the Place where their Fingers uſed to be, as if they had their Arm entire, although their Fingers are not there, nor by Conſequence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46662:14"/>their Soul. The ſecond is of a Man that's Blind, which he often inſtances, who makes his Staff ſupply the Loſs of his Eyes, to diſtinguiſh the Figure and Qualities of Objects: Who knows by the Aſſiſtance of his Stick, whether it be Water, Earth or Graſs that he touches; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Floor be Rough or Smooth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is certain he perceives all this by his Staff, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no one will ſay, That his Soul is in it. He then demonſtrated, That the Impreſſion of Objects upon our Body conſiſted only in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Nerves and Fibres, that are ſpread throughout the Parts, it being unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Soul ſhould be co-extended with them. But it was ſuffcient to her for the perception of Objects, that that Vibration ſhould be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to ſome principal part where ſhe kept her Reſidence; juſt as the Vibration caus'd by the touch of a ſoft, or hard, of a rough or ſmooth Body, communicates it ſelf to the Hand by the Mediation of the Staff; that as the Staff ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the Hand to the Body, which it touches, is inſtrumental to the Soul for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Qualities of the Body; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Nerves drawn out, for inſtance, from the Brain to the Hand, may be miniſterial to its perception of the Body that the Hand doth touch. And that in fine, The Pain, caus'd by the too near approach of a Finger to the Fire, doth no more ſuppoſe the Souls actual Preſence in that part of the Body, than does the ail of a Finger, of which a certain Maid complain'd from day to day, whoſe Arm, being gangreen'd,<note place="margin">Let. de Deſc.</note> was cut off without her Knowledg. For ſhe only felt the Pain, becauſe the Humours, or ſome other Cauſe, made a Concuſſion in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46662:15"/>Nerves of her Arm, which ran before to the end of her Hand, and becauſe they ſtrook them in a manner like to that which was formerly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to excite a Pain in the Finger, before ſhe loſt her Arm.</p>
            <p>Having made this firſt Step, and drawn a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that Importance and Satisfaction, from ſo abſtracted a Principle as the Indiviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul; it was eaſy for him to prove, ſhe kept her Court no where but in the Brain. There it is that the Nerves do center, or rather from thence they have their Origin. It is there that the Philoſophers, if you except a few, and in thoſe <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> who ſeiz'd with a Whim, plac'd the Soul in the Breaſt; it is there, I ſay, that the Philoſophers generally agree to be found that which we call the Common Senſe, that is to ſay, the only place where the Soul can be advis'd of all the different Impreſſions that external Objects make upon the Senſes. But ſince the Brain is of large Extent, and beſides that ſoft and whitiſh Subſtance, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly goes by that Name, hath Membranes, Glands, Ventricles or Cavities, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intricate to reſolve, and preciſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in what place the Soul was ſeated. <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> throughly examin'd the different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Philoſophers and Phyſicians thereupon, and after having ſolidly confuted the greateſt part of their Sentiments, that were founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but weak and unſound Principles, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently concludes, The ſeat of the Soul muſt have three Conditions: Firſt, it muſt be one; to the end that the Action of the ſame Object that at the ſame time, ſtrikes two Organs of the ſame Senſe, ſhould make no more than one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46662:15"/>Impreſſion on the Soul, as to inſtance, ſhe might not ſee two Men where there was but one.<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Let. <hi>36.</hi>
               </note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it muſt be very near the Source of the Animal Spirits; that by their means ſhe might eaſily move the Members. And in the third Place, it muſt be Moveable; that the Soul cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to move immediately, might be able to deter mine the Animal Spirits to glide towards ſome certain Muſcles rather than others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions no where to be met with but in a little Gland call'd <hi>Pineale</hi> or <hi>Conarium,</hi> ſituated betwixt all the Concavities of the Brain, ſupported and incompaſs'd with Arteries, which made up the <hi>Lacis Choroides.</hi> It is that <hi>Lacis</hi> we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd that is the ſource of the Spirits, which, aſcending from the Heart along the Carotides, receive the form of an Animal Spirit in that Gland, diſengaging themſelves there from the more groſs parts of the Blood; and from thence they take their Courſe towards the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Muſcles of our Body, partly dependent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, partly independently on the Soul; as the Author of Nature has order'd it, with reference to the end he propos'd to himſelf in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mankind.</p>
            <p>So far <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> took Reaſon along with him for his Guide; and for ought I know he might have ſtop'd there, had not Fortune, or rather the good Providence of God (who often encourages the laudable Curioſity of thoſe that apply themſelves to the conſideration of his wonderful Works) reveal'd to him in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner the Secret that he was in ſearch of. And that was without doubt one of the moſt ſtrange Effects of the deſires of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Soul,<note place="margin">P.

            <p>Should you believe me, <hi>added he,</hi> if I ſhould tell you <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had often Fits of Extaſy? Why not? <hi>Said I;</hi> that's no ſuch incredible thing, of ſo Contemplative a Man as he was; nor is it a Caſe without a Preſident. Who has not heard of thoſe of the famous <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in which he often loſt himſelf, through his vehement Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Mathematical Speculations, and in one of them his Life? <hi>Syracuſe</hi> being taken by the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, whilſt he was drawing Figures in his Chamber with that earneſtneſs of Mind; the Tumult of a Town taken by Storm, was not loud enough to wake him: And he ſooner was run through by the Soldiers that had forc'd his Houſe, than he was apprehenſive of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Alas! <hi>reply'd he,</hi> with a Sigh, you'll ſee in the Conſequence of what I am relating, That the Extaſies of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> were no leſs fatal, tho' they were not of the ſame Nature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a far different Cauſe. It happen'd one Day, whilſt we were at <hi>Egmond,</hi> a little Town in <hi>Holland,</hi> which he delighted in, that he entred his Stove very early in the Morning (which he had caus'd to be built like that in <hi>Germany,</hi> where he began his Philoſophy) and ſet himſelf to thinking, as he us'd to do. Two Hours after, I came in: I found him lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Table, his Head hanging forward, ſupported with his left Hand, in which he held a little Snuſh Box, having his Finger near his Noſe, as if he was taking Snuſh. As for the reſt he was Immoveable, and held his Eyes open:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46662:16"/>The noiſe that I made in entring the Room not cauſing him to ſtir, I had the Patience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him half an Hour poſtur'd in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without his perceiving of me. In the mean while there happen'd an Adventure that much ſurpriz'd me: There ſtood upon the Corniſh of the Wainſcot in the Stove, a Bottle of the Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Water; I was amaz'd to ſee it deſcend, whilſt no Body came near it, and to paſs through the Air towards <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> The Cork, with which it was ſtopt, came out of its own Accord, and the Bottle faſtning it ſelf to his Noſe, hung there for ſome time. I proteſt I durſt have ſwore at that moment, there had been no ſmall Conjuring in the Buſineſs of our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and that ſome familiar <hi>Demon,</hi> like that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> had inſpir'd him with all the fine Things he ſtill had taught us. But I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd not long after that there was nothing leſs in it, and I deſire you to ſuſpend your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon. He awaken'd a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as in a ſtart, and ſtriking his Hand upon the Table, <hi>This time at last,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have it.</hi> I thought him ſtill in a Dream: And ſpringing up forth with upon his Chair, tranſported with Joy, without ſeeing me, he cut two Capers in the middle of the Room, ſtill repeating, <hi>I have it, I have it.</hi> I burſt out with Laughter to ſee that Frolick, a thing not cuſtomary with <hi>M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> being naturally of a Grave and Melancholy Temper; who hearing and ſeeing me at the ſame time, preſently redden'd, and afterwards fell a Laughing as well as I. And as I was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with him to give me the Reaſon of his Joy and Rapture: To puniſh you, ſays he, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſerved an <hi>Indecorum</hi> unbecoming a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46662:17"/>you ſhall not know't ſo ſoon: And with that he left the Room in which we were, and entred into his Cloſet, bolting it upon him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs two days after he imparted to me the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>We took a turn together out of Town, and after occaſional Diſcourſe of ſeveral Things; Well, ſaid he, abruptly, without recourſe to <hi>Mercury</hi>'s <hi>Caduceus,</hi> I have found out the Secret, not only of the Union of the Soul and Body, but alſo how to ſeparate them when I pleaſe: I have experienc'd it already. That was the Product of the Meditation, wherein you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me the other day; and when I ſeem'd to you to awake of a ſuddain, I came farther a Field than you imagine: He ſpoke this in ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and poſitive a way, that he ſeem'd to be in earneſt. It ſhall be your Fault, <hi>added he,</hi> if you are not convinc'd of the Truth of what I ſay, and of the Experiment. It is the moſt curious Secret in the World. I am reſolv'd to commit it but to very few; but that Adherency which you have manifeſted until this time unto me, will not ſuffer me to be reſerv'd in any thing. He went on, without giving me time to complement his Generoſity, and related that extraordinary Event in all its Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>He told me, that being ſix'd attentively upon the Queſtion which the <hi>Princeſs Elizabeth</hi> had propos'd, touching the Union of the Soul and Body, and revolving in his Mind his former Thoughts upon that Subject, in the midſt of that extraordinary Application, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch a ſtrange Surprizal in an Inſtant, that he was not capable, when he told me of it, to expreſs himſelf clearly thereupon, nor could
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46662:17"/>he gain ſo diſtinct a Conception of it as when actually he was in it. All that he could tell me, was, That it reſembled a Trance, becauſe in that there is no uſe of the Senſes; one can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther See, nor Hear, nor Feel the Impreſſion of External Objects (unleſs they be extreamly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) and then there is an end of it: But herein it was quite different; ſince the Soul had Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of it Self, and was apprehenſive of the Ceſſation of its Organical Functions: Which in a Trance is nothing ſo. That ſhe was furniſh'd with a World of Immaterial or purely Spiritual Notices, of which he had ſometime diſcours'd to us, but in an abundantly more perfect and lively manner, than when his Attention was diſturb'd with the appearances of Fancy, which conſtantly interrupt it: That more Diſcoveries of Truth could be made thus in one Minute, than in ten years by the ordinary means; which Knowledg of Truth fill'd the Soul with ſo pure and ſatisfactory a Joy, that nothing is more true than what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, likely upon the ſame Experience, That the compleat Happineſs of Man, in this Life, if there is any ſuch thing, conſiſts in the Contemplation of God and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beings.</p>
            <p>But he told me, he had no ſenſe of that perfect Joy, till he was fully enlightned upon the Point that then took up his Thoughts: Which was done in a Moment. He had the ſatisfaction not only to know, but to be ſenſible, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, of the Truth of the greateſt part of thoſe Things which had imploy'd his Meditations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that time; and of the Evidence of the Idea's he had fram'd concerning the Eſſence of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul; to ſee her advanc'd upon her Pineal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46662:18"/>Gland he had conjectur'd, and to ſee that the Union of the Soul with the Body was nothing leſs, then that vertual, or rather imaginary Extenſion, by which ſhe was ſuppos'd commenſurate with the Limbs; much leſs thoſe imaginary Modes, which the Schools makes uſe of, to confound and plague the Conceptions of Youth. But that which was of moſt Importance was, to ſee; that this Union was nothing in Effect, but theſe actual Commerce and Correſpondence the Soul and Body had with one another. A Commerce that chiefly is maintain'd in this, that the Nerves ſpread through the Body, by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration give occaſion to the Soul of knowing the different impreſſions, External Objects make upon the Senſes; and in that the Soul purſuant thereupon, by the Motion ſhe immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſses upon the Pineal Gland where all the Nerves concentre, determines the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to their ſeveral marches through the Muſcles, to produce in the Body ſuch ſeveral Motions as ſhe ſhall pleaſe to give, and eſpecially thoſe that are neceſſary to her Preſervation.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>(purſu'd, my old Friend) M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> entertain'd me with all that happen'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occaſion, and all the other Reflections he had made. The Principal of which was, That his Soul in that juncture no longer perceiving the Motions, external Objects caus'd upon his Body, and by conſequence that Commerce, in which the Eſſence of Union conſiſted, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhe could behold her ſelf as in a ſeparate State, though in the mean time ſhe reſided at her uſual Abode; that local Preſence having the leaſt ſhare in her Union with the Body: She then had a mind to diſengage her ſelf from the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46662:18"/>Body, and ſee what would be the Event of that Separation. No ſooner had ſhe wiſht it, than it was ſo. And he farther experienc'd what he had often ſuggeſted to us before, that if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of the Body had all its Organs ſound and free; if it had its cuſtomary Heat in the Heart and Stomack, the circulation of the Blood, the filtration of the Humours, and all thoſe natural Functions, all the Motions conſtantly perform'd in us without the notice of the Soul, would go on as regularly in her abſence, as when ſhe was there. Moreover it fell out as ſhe was buſy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the operation of her Body at ſome paces diſtance from it, a Fly fortun'd to tickle it in the Face; preſently the Hand rais'd it ſelf to the place, and unſeated the Fly juſt as if the Soul had been actually in the Body. So true it is that the greateſt part of the Motions of our Body, which we attribute to the Soul, are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſole Diſpoſition of the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Soul before ſhe durſt venture to wander very far from the Body, made her <hi>entry</hi> and <hi>exit</hi> ſundry times; and judging by the dispoſition in which ſhe ſaw it, ſhe might without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger leave it for ſome time, ſhe haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded the undertaking a very long Voyage. She arriv'd at <hi>Beitany</hi> in the Houſes of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and from thence ſhe made a Sally unto <hi>Paris</hi> to the Houſe of ſome other Acquaintance. She was much concern'd to ſee that the People there had but an indiffernt Opinion of her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the Country <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had choſe to live in, and ſome unwaranted Inferences that one or other had drawn from his Principles, had given occaſion to thoſe raſh Cenſures. It is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding true, that all the time he liv'd and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46662:19"/>when he dy'd, he was a ſound and honeſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
            <p>Finally, ſuch was the ſucceſs the Soul found in her Rambles when ſeparate from the Body, that ſhe could when ſhe pleas'd in a Minute tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel three or four thouſand Leagues: In ſo much that this of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> parting from <hi>Egmond</hi> about half an hour after eight in the Morning, had travers'd all <hi>France</hi> in an hour and an half, and was return'd at ten.</p>
            <p>Bleſs me! ſaid I to my old Gentleman, how expedient would that be for a Perſon that ſo paſſionately deſires to ſee the Country as I do! You ſhall gratify your Curioſity, <hi>anſwer'd he;</hi> but hear me out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> Soul being return'd from he Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in <hi>France,</hi> found her Body almoſt in the ſame poſture in which ſhe left it. But as yet ſhe was not fully Satisfy'd. She was unacquainted with the way and means that led her into this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And ſhe conſider'd it was an hazardous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, and that being once united to her Body, ſhe might never, for ought ſhe knew, be disjoyn'd again, till Death ſhould cauſe a final Separation. She apply'd her ſelf therefore ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Nature of her Body, and the diſpoſition of all its Organs: She found that the Nerves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Sentation, and thoſe that ſerve for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural functions, as the beating of the Heart, the circulation of the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were of a Nature quite diſtinct. She ſaw that theſe were vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtended, and ſhe concluded it might be for the better communicating the Animal Spirits to the Muſcles with which the Nerves are united, and capacitating them to maintain and continue thoſe natural Motions, the Soul is not aware of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46662:19"/>when united with the Body; and that, on the contrary, the Nerves made uſe of in Senſation, and by whoſe Means the Soul received the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Objects, were almoſt all unbraced, and lax, which might prevent the Motion, cauſed by the Impulſe of Objects, from being continued unto the Seat of the Soul: The Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was to find the true Cauſe why one ſhould be taxed without the other, and how ſhe might bring it about to diſtend thoſe that formerly were laxed.</p>
            <p>Mean while the Snuſh-Box, which I mention'd, his Body held in its left-Hand, made <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> call to mind, That before his Extaſie he had taken Tabaccco-Snuſh, and he could not tell but ſo extraordinary an Effect might have been produced by the Vertue of that Tobacco. That which he took of was an unuſual kind, which a Merchant of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> had brought over from an <hi>Iſland</hi> near <hi>China,</hi> and preſented him: It was extreamly ſtrong, and <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> to molliſie it had mix'd a certain Herb in it, dryed to Powder, whoſe Name he never would acquaint me with, nor the Place where it grew, though he preſented me with a great Quantity of the ſame: He laid a ſufficient Doſe upon the Back-Side of his Hand, and gave it his Body to take; and at the ſame Time happen'd this prodigious Effect in his Brain; for all the Vapours raiſed there ſince his laſt taking were diſlodged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated in an inſtant. He obſerved it was only the Particles of the Tobacco that ſcattered the Fumes of the Brain, and that thoſe of the Herb which he had tempered with it being not ſo fine, and having very little Motion, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves in the Nerves that cauſe Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46662:20"/>and and made them looſer than they were before.</p>
            <p>Seeing that Effect, he no longer doubted, but concluded it to be the Herb, which he mix'd with the Tobacco, that caus'd his Trance, and took away his Senſes; and that the Tobacco? at the ſame Time unharbouring all the Fumes that might benight the Brain, left the Soul with the entire Liberty of knowing and reflecting on it's ſelf, as ſhe had then experienc'd. After which he thought that <hi>Hungary Water</hi> was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient to brace the Nerves afreſh, that ſerve for Senſation, ſince it is often uſed to recal thoſe Perſons that ſwoon away. The Soul takes the Bottle, I not long ſince mentioned, and brings it in the Air from the far Side of the Chamber to his Body, (and therein conſiſts exactly the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of which I then ſuſpected <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> guilty) and moiſtens his Noſtrils with it: The ſubtile Vapour of that Liquor effected what he aimed at; preſently the laxed Nerves erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Soul ſtreight ſeats it ſelf in the Pineal Gland, and finds itſelf confederate with the Body as before. It was in that inſtant I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Deſcartes</hi> to come to himſelf. I told you, he lock'd himſelf forthwith in another Room, it was to make a ſecond Experiment of his Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co and his Herb, which ſucceeded to his Hearts Deſire: Since when, it was a Buſineſs of nothing for his Soul to leave the Body; and ſince his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting to me the Secret, his Soul and mine have made an hundred Expeditions together, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our ſelves of the greateſt Curioſities in Nature.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46662:20"/>
            <p>As thoſe that read the Works of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> are unacquainted with all that I have been relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they with juſt Cauſe are amazed at a thing, which you will not ſtartle at for the future. I mean the Particulars he deſcends to in his <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> concerning the Properties of his three Elements, at how great ſoever remove from Senſe they lie; concerning their Figure, their Motion, their Rank and File in the Compoſition of his World, and all particular Bodies, concerning the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> in which he proceeds ſo far as to obſerve the different ſize of the Balls of the ſecond Element, of which they conſiſt,<note place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi> Princip.</note> in their reſpective Places, how thoſe that come neareſt the Centre of the <hi>Water</hi> are the leaſt of all; thoſe that are a little removed are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger, increaſing ſtill in Bigneſs unto a determinate Diſtance, after which they all are equal. Concerning the Formation of their Parts chamfer'd in Faſhion of a Skrew, with which he explains the Nature and the different <hi>Phenomena's</hi> of the Load-Stone, in a way ſo fine and eaſie, <hi>Phoenomena's</hi> that till then had puzled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all the Philoſophers, even thoſe that had ſo ready a Method of explaining all things by the Aſſiſtance of their occult Qualities: All this he ſaw intuitively, and of himſelf.; and for me that ſpeak to you, is it poſſible to think, That at the Age of ſeventy ſeven, and being of ſo weak a Conſtitution as I am; I ſay, is it poſſible for you to think I ſhould have lived to this, and preſerved my Health and Vigour as I do, unleſs I had had a perfect Knowledge of the Machine of my Body? Unleſs I had ſtill ſilled and made up the Breaches whereat Life leaks and runs out continually? I mean not, in applying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46662:21"/>that Medicine preſcribes, whoſe conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are ſo very uncertain, and from the Uſe of which <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> has ſo frequently diſſuaded the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. de Deſcartes.</note> But in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that Critical Knowledge my Soul has of my Body, of which ſhe perfectly is, and can be inſtructed as often as ſhe pleaſes, by putting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Capacity I have now been ſpeaking of. I muſt acknowledg Sir, <hi>replyed I,</hi> then, it is a moſt admirable Secret and of Infinite Uſe; I am impatient till. I learn it of you, and as ſoon as I know it I am perſuaded I ſhall improve it to as great a Benefit as <hi>Adam</hi> would have done the <hi>Tree of Life in</hi> Paradiſe, if he had continued there. And I doubt not but if <hi>Origen</hi> had known it, he that looks upon the Hiſtory of Scripture as <hi>Allegory,</hi> he would have believed the Tree of Life to be nothing but this Myſtery which God had communicated unto <hi>Adam:</hi> But that which you was ſpeaking of your Health, creates one Scruple in me; How <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> having the Advantage of this fine Knowledg came to dye at the Age of fifty four? Was he ſo much out of Love with his Life as to neglect the repairing thoſe effluxes of his Machine, whoſe Failures and Diſaſters he could ſo eaſily foreſee?</p>
            <p>Do you believe then, <hi>returned he,</hi> that <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> is dead? I know not, ſaid I, how you underſtand it, but methinks the Corps of a Man ſhould not be buried unleſs he was dead before; and all the World knows that in the Year 1650. the Body of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was interred at <hi>Stockholm</hi> with great Pomp and Solemnity,<note place="margin">M. Cherſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier pref. de Lett. de M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> by the Care of <hi>M. Chanut,</hi> his particular Friend, and then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>France</hi> at the Court of <hi>Sweden:</hi> That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46662:21"/>ſince <hi>M. Dalibert</hi> hath ordered his Bones to be removed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to be diſpoſed of in the Church of S. <hi>Geneve,</hi> where his Epitaph is to be ſeen, engraven upon a fair White Marble: It ſeems to me once more, That all this ſuppoſes a Man as dead as dead can be.</p>
            <p>All theſe Particulars are true, ſaid my <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian;</hi> but for all that it is falſe that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> is dead; for that we call Death is when our Body becoming incapable of Vital Functions, either by the Defailure of the Organs, which are wore out in the Succeſſion of Years, or corrupted by ſome Diſeaſe, or endammaged by ſome Hurt or Wound, the Soul is oblig'd to quit her Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, following the Laws of their Union eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by the Sovereign Maſter of the Univerſe: But <hi>Carteſius</hi>'s Soul was by no means ſeparated from his Body after this manner. Hear then the Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>About three or four Months after his Arrival in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> where Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had invited him, and did him the Honour to entertain him in her Library an Hour in a Morning every Day:<note place="margin">Pref. de lett. de Deſcartes.</note> He was ſeized in the midſt of Winter with an Inflammation of the Lungs, ſeconded with a Giddineſs in the Brain; but the Fever having left his Brain, there had been no great Difficulty in his Recovery.<note place="margin">Lett. de Deſcartes.</note> Himſelf had wrote a little Time before to one of his Friends, That he had made ſome Diſcoveries in Anatomy, that inſur'd his Life for an hundred Years: And 'tis known that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> did not uſe to go by Gueſſing, or advance any thing without a firm Aſſurance; but an unſeaſonable Misfortune rendred his Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction fruitleſs; ſeeing he had not reſted well that Night, his Soul had a Mind to take a little
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46662:22"/>Turn for Recreation-ſake; he takes his uſual Doſe of Snuſh, and his Soul leaves his Body in the Bed. By ill Luck the Phyſician, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Cuſtom came to viſit him at Midnight; the Noiſe he made, in entring the Chamber, did not awake his Body, whoſe Senſes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly laid aſleep by vertue of the Herb, of which I ſpoke, that was mingled with the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco: But having put to his Noſe a Vial of extreamly Spirituous Liquor, to fortifie the Brain, it made a more quick and lively Sally upon the Organ of Senſe than <hi>Hungary Water</hi> uſed to do, which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> Soul made uſe of when ſhe would re-enter the Body, and conclude its Trance; it cauſed it to open its Eyes, and to give ſome Groans. The Phyſician ask'd it how he did? The Machine accuſtomed, ſome Days ago to anſwer to that Queſtion, <hi>That he was very ill,</hi> made ſtill the ſame reply; but to other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions the Phyſician propoſed (ſince the Soul was not there to talk rationally, and anſwer to the purpoſe) the Anſwers were full of Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and <hi>Delirium,</hi> juſt as the Machine was determined by the Voice of the Doctor: It talked eternally of the Separation of its Soul from its Body, becauſe the laſt Thoughts the Soul entertained in the Act of ſeparating herſelf were thoſe of that Separation, which had left ſome Figures or Traces ſtamp'd upon the Brain, anſwering to thoſe Thoughts, and determining the Tongue to a Motion, requiſite to pronounce ſuch ſort of Words. Theſe Symptoms enduc'd the Doctor to believe he was again tranſported with a Raving in his Head; wherefore he is out of Hand blooded in the Foot, Cupping-Glaſſes are apply'd, and ſeveral other Violent Remedies,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46662:22"/>which ſo exhauſted and altered his poor Body, that in a ſhort Time it had ſpent all its Strength; it's natural Heat began to faint, and loſe itſelf by little and little; a Defluction of his Brain fell into his Breaſt; and in a Word, it became a meer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daver,</hi> and unable to perform the Duties of Life, and to receive his Soul. Thus it happened; ſo that you ſee a Man may truly ſay, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> is not dead.</p>
            <p>Aſſuredly Sir <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> this is not to dye according to <hi>due Form and Method;</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Swediſh Phyſician</hi> would be held Guiltleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Faculties of <hi>Europe;</hi> for he has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Rules of his Art he acted according to appearance, and if he did but underſtand what you are teaching me, That <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> is not dead, he might boaſt of the Greateſt and moſt unprecedented Exploit that was ever known in Medicine, I mean to have killed a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſing him to die. But Sir, I beſeech you <hi>(continued I)</hi> acquaint me, if you know, What was the Deſtiny of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> Soul; for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uncontroverted Principles of our Faith, a Soul in leaving this World receives her Arreſt for Eternity, and either has her Portion in Paradice, Hell or Purgatory for ſome Time.</p>
            <p>That Queſtion ruffled my old Gentleman; And in the Name of God <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> almoſt in a Paſſion, rid your ſelf of that Ridiculous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom you have taken up in the Schools, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing Queſtions of Religion in Matters purely Philoſophical. <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had once thought to renounce his Philoſophy, or at leaſt refuſe to publiſh his Works, to ſave him the Trouble of anſwering thoſe impertinent Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46662:23"/>which were made at every turn and upon all occaſions. I am giving you clear Matter of Fact, and you deſire me to Account for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God. But in brief, have not I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd all your Difficulties, when I told you <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was not Dead? And ſince he is not Dead, why demand you if he has ſubmitted to a Judgment, the Dead are only concern'd in?</p>
            <p>I beg'd his Pardon for my Imprudence; and agreed with him, That nothing was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable and inconvenient, than ſuch ſort of occaſional Queſtions, to a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> that had made a <hi>Syſtem</hi> without regard to any thing of that Nature. And that likewiſe put me in mind of entreating my Readers, to uſe the ſame Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor towards me. That they will not wrangle with me, upon the Point of ſeparate Souls, whole Shoals of which I meet with in my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the <hi>World of Deſcartes,</hi> nor tye me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the Scruples, they might be able to raiſe on that Account. For therein bottom the moſt agreeable Paſſages of my Hiſtory, with which I ſhould not preſent the <hi>Publick,</hi> but upon that Condition. I would entreat them to remember the Priviledg theſe <hi>Carteſian Gentlemen</hi> take, who when perplex'd in anſwering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought againſt the Eſſence of Matter, and drawn from the Sacrament of the Hoſt, think they have right to cry out, They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd; That their Philoſophy is ſequeſtred from Things relating to Faith; That they are <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and not <hi>Divines,</hi> and undertake the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Myſteries of Nature, not of Religion: I would, I ſay, they'd do me the like Juſtice; or, if they had rather, the ſame Favour. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46662:23"/>ſuppoſing any one ſo Religious, as to ſuſpect me of the Hereſie of thoſe, who ſay, The Souls in parting from the Body are not doom'd for Eternity; I wiſh he'd conſider once more, that I am in this, an <hi>Historian</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> not a <hi>Theologiſt,</hi> and give a Relation of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> am not making a Profeſſion of Faith. Which the Character of an Hiſtory (ſuch as I am upon) will bear, far more independently of the Truths of our Religion, than a Syſtem of Philoſophy. Any one that knows never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle muſt be forc'd to acknowledg this: Which being once ſuppos'd, I return to the Narrative of my <hi>Old Gentleman,</hi> who thus went on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Soul returning to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> found her ſelf in the like unlucky Circumſtances, as did one <hi>Hermotimus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> who having procur'd the ſelf-ſame Secret as <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> left conſtantly anights, his Body aſleep in Bed, whilſt his Soul went a rambling through the World. Both one and the other, at their return, found their Lodgings out of a Capacity to receive them.</p>
            <p>The Task <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Soul enjoyn'd her ſelf then, was, to meet at <hi>Paris.</hi> She would not tell me preſently of the Accident, but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to take a turn or two: No ſooner ſaid than done. With one Snuff of the Tobacco, I equipt my ſelf to wait on her. My Soul was no ſooner out of my Body, but ſhe ſaid, in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Spiritual, ſhe was about to tell me ſtrange News. I am, ſays ſhe, no longer Imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd; my Corps is this day to be interr'd at <hi>Stockholm;</hi> and he gave me the Particulars of what I have been relating: Nor did ſhe ſeem ſab or afflicted thereupon. I then demanded of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46662:24"/>her if ſhe experienc'd what the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, That the Soul being the ſubſtantial Form of the Body, when ſeparated for good and all, is <hi>in ſtatu violento.</hi> She anſwer'd me, ſhe knew nothing of that violent State, but found her ſelf incomparably better out, than in the Body: And that ſhe had but one Concern upon her, to know in what part of the vaſt Space was beſt to ſettle her Abode in. That ſhe would take my Directions in the thing, but that ſhe found her Will inclin'd for the <hi>third Heaven. The third Heaven,</hi> according to the diviſion <hi>Carteſius</hi> makes of the World, is the laſt of all, and that which is the fartheſt remov'd from us. For the <hi>firſt</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Vortex,</hi> in which is plac'd the Earth, whoſe Centre is the Body of the Sun, about which, the Coeleſtial Matter that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>Vortex,</hi> carries us, and makes us turn continually like the other Planets. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Heaven is incomparably larger than that in which we are, and takes up all that mighty ſpace in which we ſee the fix'd Stars, which are ſo many Suns, and have each of them a <hi>Vortex,</hi> of which they are themſelves the Centre, as our Sun is of this. Laſtly, the <hi>third</hi> Heaven is all that Matter, or all that indefinite Extent, which we conceive above the Starry Heaven, and is void of Bounds, and in reſpect of which the ſpace of all the other may be conſider'd as a Point.</p>
            <p>Now many Reaſons determin'd <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to chooſe his place of Reſidence in the higheſt Heaven. The firſt was, To avoid the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of an Innumerable gang of Souls of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> that were vaulting and fluttering on all parts of this our <hi>Vortex;</hi> for, to tell you by the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46662:24"/>way, 'tis incredible how many Souls we met up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Journey: And <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was much ſurpriz'd to ſee the Secret, of which he took himſelf to be the firſt Inventer, made uſe of in all times, even by thoſe of a very mean Quality, whereby they have eſcap'd a dying, or whoſe Souls have loſt their Bodies by ſome Accident, not unlike that of <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> But that which made their Company ſo diſreliſht, and perfectly intolerable to <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Spirit, was, That theſe Souls, ſo diſentangled as they were from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were tinctur'd ſtill with Prejudice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were prepoſſeſs'd, when united with their Bodies. That when he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſs'd with them about the Principles of Bodies, and the Cauſes of ſeveral Phoenomena's, they faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppos'd to him, or prov'd by the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle, ſubſtantial Forms, abſolute Accidents,</hi> and <hi>occult Qualities,</hi> as is done to this day in many Schools. And except ſome few Souls of the higheſt Rank, which he hath converted and proſelyted to <hi>Carteſianiſm,</hi> all are inveterate and inleagu'd againſt him with as immoderate Fury, as the Philoſophers of this World when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to publiſh his Doctrin here.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon that byaſs'd him to that Election, was, becauſe he look'd upon thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Spaces as a new Diſcovery, of which he was the Author. For it was upon his forming a diſtinct Idea of Matter, whoſe Eſſence conſiſted in Extenſion, that he concluded Space, Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Matter, to be one and the ſame thing, ſignify'd under different Names: And being it was neceſſary to admit of a Space and an Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion above our World, ſince we have a moſt clear Conception of them, it was plain, That
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46662:25"/>above our World there was Matter too, and as we can have no Idea of any Bounds or Limits that Matter has, it is neceſſary it ſhould be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or rather Indefinite.</p>
            <p>Finally, the third and moſt prevailing Reaſon of all, and which he intimated not to me, until we arrived upon the place, is, that well, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing the Matter above the fix'd Stars to be uninform'd, and not yet ſhap'd into a World, he was in good hopes that he was able to ſet it to work himſelf, and fancy'd that in dividing and agitating it, according to his <hi>Principles,</hi> he could reduce it to a World like this, excepting that it would be deſtitute of real Men, and only ſtor'd with <hi>Automatous Machines</hi> in their Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That Project was the Subject of the moſt part of his Books, eſpecially of his <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> and that Entituled, <hi>The World of</hi> M. Deſcartes. We ſet out immediately for the third Heaven. I ſhall not deſcend to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of our Voyage. I hope in a few days you'll bear me Company there your ſelf. I'll only ſay, that upon our Coaſting, we found all Things exactly in that Portrait we had drawn before, without Form, without due Order, or any regular poſture of the Parts, as rude and unſightly Materials, that require the Hand of the Artiſt. We ſurvey'd it all about, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd our ſelves a long time in the vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of the other World; which perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me the Face of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and that confus'd Maſs of which the Poets ſpeak. That enterview, as much a Spirit as I was, fill'd me full of Horror, ſo hideouſly frightful it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd. It is notwithſtanding here (<hi>ſaid the Spirit of</hi> M. Deſcartes) that I will fix; nor will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46662:25"/>I quit this Place till the Providence of God ſhall diſpoſe of me for Eternity; he brought me into the World to reform and re-eſtabliſh the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> of it. I had with good Succeſs began the Buſineſs I was ſent upon; but one unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, not in my Power to foreſee, prevented me from proſecuting my Deſign: That ſhall not hinder me from uſing the Knowledg he hath given me to the beſt Advantage. I preſume, to accompliſh here the <hi>Syſtem of my World,</hi> of which you have ſeen the Draught: Matter here is plenty and to ſpare, and only Motion's want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I have all encouragement to hope, That God, who, of his Goodneſs, uſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, in Quality of an Univerſal Cauſe, to the Thoughts and Inclinations of his Creatures, conformably to their Nature, will not be wanting to me. Being a ſeparate Spirit, I can lay Claim to greater Motions far than thoſe that ſet the Wheels of all the World below a going: I ſhall no ſooner deſire the Moving of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but God, purſuant to the Laws of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will create ſo much Motion as I have a Mind to: There will be need of nothing more than the Determination of that Motion, and the Diſtribution of it, according to the particular Neceſſities of every part of Matter. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, as I have heretofore explained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on Second Cauſes, which Province will entirely belong to me; I know very well the Rules; the Conſequences I have drawn from thoſe Rules will infallibly compaſs my Deſign. In ſhort, I find my ſelf in a Capacity, according to my <hi>Principles</hi> to warrant the Succeſs of my Enterpriſe; ſince notwithſtanding the Machine I undertake is of an unweildy Pigneſs, for I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46662:26"/>deſign to make it as capacious as <hi>our World,</hi> and muſt be compoſed of an infinite different Parts, ſince the Engines that muſt be plaid are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, ſince the <hi>Combinations</hi> and the different <hi>Determinations</hi> of Motions muſt be infinite, it will not be the Work of one Day, nor one Year; half an Age is not too much for an Human Spirit for projecting ſuch a Grand Deſign: But I am perſuaded, my Principles ſuppoſed, it will be ſufficient. I ſhall take no Satisfaction in Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that ſhall come and interrupt me, during that Space of Time: I will now begin to enjoy the Pleaſures of Solitude, which I could never find on Earth, and I intreat you to manifeſt my Intentions thereupon to all my Friends below, whom you think it convenient to acquaint with my Circumſtances, without telling them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely where I am; for once more I ſay, I would not have them know exactly what's become of me, nor what I am a doing: The Men there, and eſpecially the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> deſerve not to be admitted to the Knowledge of theſe great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they'd ridicule as fabulous what ever you ſhould ſay concerning me, as they did for the moſt part entertain as Whim and <hi>Chimera</hi> all that I revealed of my Project touching the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a World.</hi> As for you, <hi>my dear Friend,</hi> I would that you return to your Body, which now you have left almoſt two Days; too long faſting may inflame it, and introduce a Fever: Above all, take Care you never finally abdicate it, upon your own Authority, which ſome of my <hi>Diſciples</hi> have been guilty of, and ſo many Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Philoſophers</hi> that we met in diverſe Places; for that is contrary to the Decree of Providence. Enquire in your Way for the Spirit of <hi>Father
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46662:26"/>Merſennus,</hi> and ſend him hither; I'll take him to me for an Aſſiſtant, and to keep me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Having receiv'd the laſt Orders of this dear Spirit, and obtain'd Permiſſion to give him a Viſit once at leaſt, in three or four Years Time; having conſidered the great Violence I ſhould ſuffer, in being ſo long diſtracted from him, and the Danger likewiſe I was in of being ſo for ever, in caſe I ſhould dye during that great Term of Years, he had deſtined to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his World; we ſpiritually imbrac'd each other, and I ſtood forwith for <hi>Paris.</hi> I cut it through a vaſt number of <hi>Vortexes</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi> without diſcovering <hi>Father Merſennus;</hi> but at laſt I found him out in <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which he very much delighted, becauſe that is a very jolly Planet: I intimated to him the Orders I had for him from <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> which he imbraced with Joy, having been all-a-long his faithful Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and eſpecially at <hi>Paris.</hi> Being I was in haſte for my Departure, we had not much Diſcourſe together, ſo we parted; he bent his Courſe towards the third Heaven, my Spirit took the Way that led to my own Home, where ſhe reunited with my Body.</p>
            <p>Since that Time I have paid <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſix or ſeven Viſits; the laſt was about two Months ago. He aſſured me then, He had diſpatched almoſt all his <hi>Combinations,</hi> and that all was as good as demonſtrated: And unleſs the moſt evident Principles of <hi>Geometry, Mechanicks</hi> and <hi>Staticks</hi> were falſe, he was confident of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. He promiſed to give me notice about this Time, to come and ſee him, to the end we might take a Review together, and examine his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46662:27"/>Deſign, and may be forthwith fall to work in the <hi>Production of his World,</hi> that is to ſay, to afford me the moſt Noble Diverſion, of which an human Soul is capable. I daily expect a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to depart, and it will be your own Fault only <hi>(added he)</hi> if you are not a Sharer in this Voyage, and gain a greater Stock of Knowledg in one Day than the moſt reputed <hi>Carteſians</hi> have in all their Life. This is the Sum of all I had to ſay.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he made an End of ſpeaking, but a <hi>Country Gentleman,</hi> of no mean Rank, of a good and genteel Preſence, though I diſliked the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of his Viſit at that inſtant, entred his Chamber, in a Country Habit, ſaying, his Coach ſtood ready at the Gate, and that it was Time to go. It was a Deſign they had agreed on, to take the Air for a Fortnight; which obliged me to take my Leave of them and retire.</p>
            <p>I knew not what to think of this Relation: I never took him for an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> that had given it me: And ſurely (thought I) this Story is too well purſued to be a Dream. I then conceived it might be ſome myſterious <hi>Allegory,</hi> containing all the Secrets of the Sect, of which he would give me afterwards the Explication. I applyed my ſelf however to the reading of my fine <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> and I compaſſed him during the Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, though it coſt me many a Head-ake, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the too great Intention of Thought: But I underſtood in the Conſequence, That all he had ſaid was far from <hi>Allegory,</hi> and that he ought to be taken in a Literal Senſe, at the end of his <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>old Friend</hi> being returned from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſent me a Letter, the next Morning, in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46662:27"/>which he notiſied, He would ſee me before four and twenty Hours were at an end, and that I ſhould put my ſelf in a Readineſs for my <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> I waited all the Day, with great Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but ſeeing at laſt he did not come, about ten a Clock I went to Bed; half an Hour after, being yet awake, I was amazed to hear my Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains drawn on all Sides my Bed, the Caſements of my Windows to fly open with ſo vaſt a Noiſe, and to ſee, by the Aſſiſtance of the Moon, my <hi>old Gentleman</hi> in the middle of the Room, and another with him, habited in an unuſual Dreſs: I proteſt I was ſeized with ſuch a ſudden Dread, that the Hair of my Head ſtood upright, and I ſweat all over. The <hi>old Gentleman</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to my Bed-ſide, ſaid, You are fearful, take Courage a little, Don't you know me? I know you <hi>(anſwered I)</hi> in a trembling Tone, but what could I think to ſee you in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without entring at the Door, with ſuch a Noiſe and Havock as was here? What you ſhould, and ought to think, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> is, that a Spirit ſeparate from the Body, may enter any where without a Key, and needs not the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of a Door: And for the Noiſe, it was firſt to wake you, and then for the Pleaſure of ſurprizing you, and putting you in a little Fright. Do not you remember the Converſation we had together a Fortnight ſince? I well remember it <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> but was it all true you then related? Infallibly <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> and I now am come to make good my Promiſe I then made you, of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World:</hi> Here is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father Merſennus,</hi> who is now come from him, to adviſe me all is ready; and that he would be glad, before he puts the Deſign of his <hi>World</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:46662:28"/>in Execution, to make a Tryal in the Preſence of ſome of his Friends; you ſhall be of the Party if you think fit: I adviſe you not to loſe ſo fair an Opportunity. At the ſame Time <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus</hi> ſteps up, and bowing low to the Ground, confirmed what my old <hi>Philoſopher</hi> had ſaid, and added, That underſtanding by him the Character and Qualification of my Soul, he could undertake for a kind Reception from <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> Pardon <hi>Reverend Father (ſaid I)</hi> my Aſtoniſhment. I am not accuſtomed to receive ſuch Viſits: Spirits I never ſaw before, and I could never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they had been ſo civil and well-bred as I now find them.</p>
            <p>Mean while, though I us'd all poſſible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to compoſe my ſelf, I ſtill was ſomewhat fearful: I was under ſtrong Apprehenſions there might be Sorcery and Witchcraft in the Caſe, and that under pretence of guiding me unto <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> they deſign'd to convey me to the <hi>Witches Sabbath.</hi> On the other hand I fear'd to affront theſe Gentlemen-Spirits, who for the moſt part underſtand not Will and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. And my Memory furniſh'd me with a parallel Caſe, of ſome certain People cajol'd with the pretence of ſuch ſort of Myſteries, till having learn'd a part, and refuſing to go on, they had their Neck writhen by the Devil or his Accomplices: I renounc'd all manner of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting in my ſelf, and made uſe of all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions my Prudence could ſuggeſt in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; after which, I ſpoke to them as fairly as I could, in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you make Profeſſion of a <hi>Sect</hi> that gives it as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> That a Man muſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any thing but a Truth, fully and clearly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46662:28"/>manifeſt: And that it is diſtinguiſhes you from all others, and eſpecially the Philoſophers of the Schools. The Converſation I had with this <hi>Gentleman</hi> a fortnight ago, and the Critical Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſince, joyn'd with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances, create ſome Scruples in my Mind, of which I ſhould be glad to be clear'd before we go any farther. Will you take kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I ſhall propoſe? We will hear you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>(anſwer'd they)</hi> and you ſhall have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you demand. Only ſettle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf, for you ſeem a little diſturb'd: And reſolve your ſelf you need not fear, and that you ſhall receive no harm.</p>
            <p>Thoſe laſt Words a little reviv'd me, and I began to ſpeak with a more ſteady Voice. It is not many days ſince I read in <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> That <hi>the Eſſence of the Soul conſiſts in being a thinking Subſtance,</hi> and that ſhe hath neither Extenſion, nor Figure, nor Colour; which I know not how to reconcile with what I ſee at preſent: For you give me to underſtand, you be purely Spirits, yet I perceive in you different Colours, and I ſee you form'd in the Figure of a Man, and you look like Beings that are extended: Rid me I pray you of this Perplexity. <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> preſently took the Word. What you propoſe <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> ſtands to Reaſon: But it is eaſy to anſwer you, and plainly to expound the Thing by the evident Principles of true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. It is certain a <hi>Soul</hi> is eſſentially a <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Substance,</hi> and that ſhe is neither Figur'd nor Colour'd. We are purely Spirits indeed, and though we ſeem to have a Face, and Hands, and Feet; yet we have neither Face, nor Hands, nor Feet. He muſt be as addle-brain'd as was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46662:29"/>
               <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and bent on Error with as great a Zeal as he, when he ingag'd himſelf in that Affair, Who thinks the Soul is not only Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but has alſo Parts proportion'd to the Body, which ſhe animates, and is therein juſt as a Sword is in the Scabbord. His devout Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that ſaw Souls of a blew Colour in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had topſyturn'd his Mind upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>To make you therefore comprehend how you ſee us Colour'd, Figur'd and Extended, with Face, Hands and Feet, though we have neither Extenſion, Colour, Figure, Hands nor Feet; you muſt know, your Soul, whilſt ſhe is united with the Body, cannot behold another Soul, ſo as in her ſelf ſhe is, cannot hear her Speak; or to explain my ſelf more juſtly, cannot have the immediate Communication of her Thoughts. To the end then, you might know that we are here, and that we might make you underſtand our Thoughts, and the Deſign that brought us hither, it was expedient to make uſe of means proportion'd to the Capacity your Soul at preſent's in. Now I would not have you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that for this purpoſe I was forc'd to frame my ſelf a Body of ſome Matter. But only call to mind what your reading of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ought to teach you, That to ſee an Object, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto your Soul, is nothing elſe than to perceive the Extenſion, Figures and Colours, of that Object. That that perception is not caus'd immediately by the Object, which being at a diſtance from our Body and our Soul, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act upon them of it ſelf: That therefore's done by the Reflection of Infinite Rays of Light, which rallying from every part, and every point
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46662:29"/>of the Object, ſtrike and make the ſeveral Threads to quaver, of which the Optick Nerve's compoſed. That Concuſſion is communicated to the Brain, and to the place of Reſidence of the Soul; and it is purſuant to, and on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Concuſſion, the Soul forms an Idea of the Object which ſhe perceives or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in the manner we call <hi>Seeing.</hi> And it is according to the various Modifications of that Concuſſion, that ſhe ſees Objects at ſeveral diſtances under divers Figures, and of different Colours. From whence it follows, that the Perceptions or Ideas of the Soul, have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary dependence on the Objects; but only on the exteriour Organ, which may be prov'd by a thouſand Experiments, but eſpecially by that of Phrenetick People, who perceive Objects quite different from what they really are; and ſee them where they are not.</p>
            <p>Now that you may perceive a Body in the place where I am, when no ſuch thing is there, it is ſufficient that your interiour Organ ſhould be moved in ſuch a manner, as it would be if a Body was really there. That's the thing I now am actually doing upon your Optick Nerve, to make you know that I am here: That is it, which cauſes you to ſee a Body, though in truth there is none to ſee. And what I act upon the Organ of Sight, to make a Body appear, the ſame I do in proportion upon that of <hi>Hearing,</hi> to find you Sounds and Words. I impreſs a like Motion upon the Strings of your Nerves of the fifth Conjugation, as would the Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Undulations of the Air, were it agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Motion of a Tongue and the Mouth of a Man, who ſhould ſtand where I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46662:30"/>ſeem to do, and ſhould utter the ſame Words you at preſent hear.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Principles it was,<note place="margin">F. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnan.</note> that a <hi>Father</hi> of our Order has moſt ingeniouſly unfolded the Myſteries of the Holy Sacrament, without the aſſiſtance of that Medly of abſolute Accidents, that could never be conceiv'd. For, ſays he, when we are taught the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>J. C.</hi> is under the appearance of Bread, nothing more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, than that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>J. C.</hi> is truly there, where the Bread was, and ſeems ſtill to us to be, to the end that Bread may appear where the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>J. C.</hi> actually is, God acts upon our Senſes. He there produces the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Motions, and makes the ſame Impreſſions the Bread did before. So when our <hi>Lord</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf to St. <hi>Magdalen</hi> in the form of a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> it was by acting upon her Eyes, juſt as the Viſage and Habit of the Gardiner would have done, and not by cloathing himſelf with the abſolute Accidents of a Gardiner.</p>
            <p>But that which you may gather from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Experience, is, the manner how the Dead appear, who ſometimes by God's Permiſſion preſent themſelves to thoſe alive: For they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the ſame Method as I do actually my ſelf. And thoſe Bodies of Air or Water, which ſome pretend they attire themſelves withal, are only the Whymſies and Forgeries of their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, who have treated of <hi>Devils craft</hi> in ſuppoſing the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>School Philoſophy.</hi> Have you any farther Difficulty, ſaid he, upon that Point?</p>
            <p>Ah! <hi>(Father, reply'd I)</hi> you have made it as clear as the Sun, and have given me infinite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Your Diſcourſe is altogether Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46662:30"/>I rely not much upon the Explication of that <hi>Father</hi> of your Order, upon the Myſtery of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> I take it for a Maxim with the wiſeſt of the <hi>Catholick Philoſophers,</hi> That all Novelty in ſuch ſort of Things is dangerous, at leaſt always ought to be ſuſpected. You have abſolutely diſpers'd the Doubts that troubled me. It was indeed long ago that I had a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Senſation was caus'd by the Local Motion of the Organs; but that Idea was not unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd. <hi>Aristotle</hi> had ſaid it before <hi>Carteſius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ariſt. in Probl.</note> but had not explain'd it. From this time forth I renounce for ever a great part of the Ideas I had fram'd thereupon. I ſolemnly abjure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, all the Axioms that reſpect the <hi>Active, Paſſive, and paſſible Intellect.</hi> I acknowledg they are Terms that ſignifie nothing, and are of no uſe but to make the Ignorant to ſtare, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand them, but imagine the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> can.</p>
            <p>After that Proteſtation <hi>Father Merſennus</hi>'s Soul mov'd my <hi>Organ</hi> in ſuch a manner, as gave me to apprehend he was well pleas'd. Which made me take the boldneſs of propoſing a ſecond Scruple. Father (ſaid I) I don't well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what that <hi>World</hi> is of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> where you would conduct me. For in reading <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> I did conceive his World was nothing elſe, but this of ours, explain'd by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Philoſophy.</hi> And I diſtinctly remember I have read in a Letter, he had formerly wrote theſe Words; That he ſhould think himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving of the Name of a <hi>Natural Philoſopher,</hi> if he could only tell how Things might be, without demonſtrating they could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. There he Bravado's it a little.<note place="margin">Let. <hi>37.</hi> Tom. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> But that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46662:31"/>confirms me, that when he ſpeaks the contrary, and ſays he pretends not to give an Account of Things as they are in the World, but only how they ought to be in a World, that he imagins he would be angry, ſhould we credit him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>What you ſay is true (<hi>reply'd Father</hi> Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> deſign'd not to be believed in that Particular. So that the <hi>World of</hi> M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes, is in earneſt, this World explain'd by the <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> But it is alſo true, that there is, or rather, will be very ſpeedily, another World, that may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be call'd <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> ſince it will be of his own Contrivance. And that's the World with which this Gentleman, your Friend, has entertain'd you, and that we ſhall give you a ſight of if you pleaſe. Nothing certainly <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> will be more diverting: I would quit the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or the <hi>Festivals</hi> of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Prodigy, which doubtleſs, is the compleateſt Work of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the almoſt Maſter-piece of Human Nature. But Sir <hi>(ſaid I, turning to my old Gentleman)</hi> the Story of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> you have formerly related, gives me ſome diſturbance. The Voyage you know is very long; and a World like this he is about, is not to be built in one Hour's time. I know my Soul loves her Body very well, and would be much concern'd at her return, to find it incapacitated to receive her. And an hundred Accidents may happen, againſt which no one can give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>We are provided for them all <hi>(ſaid he:)</hi> Look towards the bottom of your Bed. Good God! <hi>(I cry'd out)</hi> ſcar'd out of my Senſes: What
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46662:31"/>is't I ſee? The <hi>Devil</hi> then is one of your Club! Wretched Mortal that I am! I am loſt, undone: However I'll die without any familiarity with him. <hi>Monſieur</hi> avaunt. I renounce utterly your Enchantments and your Magick.</p>
            <p>Softly, foftly <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> why all this Alarm? He is no <hi>Devil</hi> that you ſee, though Black: He's far from being a <hi>Devil:</hi> This is the Soul of a <hi>little Black</hi> that waits upon <hi>Deſcartes.</hi> To eaſe you of all Scruples and Diſquiet in a word or two, I'll give you an Abbreviate of him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Little Black</hi> was formerly <hi>Valet</hi> to <hi>M. Regius</hi> the famous Profeſſor of Phyſick in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> who, as is known,<note place="margin">Diverſes letters de Deſcartes.</note> was then the intimate Friend, Diſciple, and Admirer of <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> Upon theſe Accounts he mexited the communication of his Secret, for the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soul and Body. Since that they broke with each other, in ſo much that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> thought himſelf oblig'd to Write againſt him. Becauſe he deprav'd his Doctrin, and made it give Offence. <hi>M. Regius,</hi> who if <hi>Deſcartes's</hi> Character be true, was none of the moſt Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and gentileſt Gentlemen in the World, to revenge himſelf, and ſhew how he ſcorn'd, and trampled on a thing, <hi>Carteſius</hi> ſet ſo high a rate upon, taught it this litle <hi>Negro:</hi> One time above the reſt, he went to make uſe of it. Returning one day from the Country, where his Maſter had ſent him, much tir'd, he ſate himſelf under the ſhade of an Oak: His Soul left his Body to its repoſe and rambled for Diverſion I know not where. Mean while ſome Highway-men kill'd a Man hard by him. The <hi>Grand Provoſt</hi> who was near, being advis'd of the Murder, came ſpeedily with his <hi>Sergeants:</hi> The Noiſe they made
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46662:32"/>was ſuch, that it awak't the Body of the <hi>Little Black:</hi> And there happen'd ſomething in the Adventure not unlike that, I told you lately, of <hi>Deſcartes.</hi> For the <hi>Machine</hi> determin'd by the Noiſe, and the ſtrong Impreſſion the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of arm'd Men made upon his Organ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fly. They purſue him, overtake him, and examine him. He contradicts himſelf at every Word, in his Anſwers, which, in the abſence of his Soul, were not likely to be very coherent. The <hi>Grand Provoſt</hi> who was a little too expeditious in the Buſineſs, took his Flight, and the Aſtoniſhment that appear'd in his Counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and his Words, for an Evident convicton of the Crime, and caus'd him to be hang'd upon a Tree, as an Accomplice of the Murder'd that was committed. The Soul returning not long after, found her Body hanging in that raſcally Poſture of a <hi>Malefactour.</hi> Forc'd then, as ſhe was, to ſeek a now Abode, ſhe was in a miſerable condition. The majority of ſeparate Souls which play in all the vaſt extent of the World, being Souls of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and Souls of great Importance, and having in a Convention held by the moſt conſiderable of them, declar'd that Opinion of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> true, that holds an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in Souls of the ſame Species: They would no ways admit that the Soul of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Negro</hi> ſhould enjoy the ſame Priviledge as they, and gave her chaſe throughout the Univerſe. In ſhort, her good Fortune would, that ſhe ſhould, attempt to paſs our <hi>Vortex</hi> and arrive at the very place <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Soul had pitch'd upon to Meditate. He had Compaſſion on her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her the liberty to live with him. <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> brought her hither, in Caſe there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46662:32"/>ſhould be occaſion, and we'll leave her with your Body to take care on't.</p>
            <p>The Retail of a Story ſo well circumſtanc'd, induc'd me to credit what was ſaid, as true. I intreated both the <hi>Spirits</hi> to excuſe the Tranſport I was guilty of telling them, that the Figure and Colour he made uſe of to appear in, being the ſame the Devil furniſhes himſelf with all, when he would be viſible, had imprinted on my Mind that horrible <hi>Idea.</hi> I deſir'd them to give me ſome Inſtructions, how I muſt be rigg'd to accompany them in that wondrous Voyage, that they propos'd; ſaying, I hop'd to make infinite Advantage of the Favour they vouchſafed me, and in their Society, to return ſo choice a Treaſure of Knowledge, as would diſtinguiſh me from the reſt of Mankind. Three things, ſay's <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> you have to do: The firſt is, To diſmantle your Mind of all the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Childhood, and the <hi>ordinary Philoſophy.</hi> For 'tis ſtrange to ſee how the Prejudices the Soul ſucks in but by the Senſes, ſhould make ſo deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the Underſtanding, with Time and Cuſtom; which ſhe chooſes for the Rule of her Opinions. In ſo much, that Souls ſeparated form their Bodies, otherwiſe than by Death, although during that ſeparation they act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently on the Senſes, do yet think, judge and reaſon conformably to their prejudice. Without that Precaution, you'l make a fruitleſs Voyage, and be but where you are, at your return.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Requiſite before our embarquing is, That you give Orders to this <hi>little Spirit,</hi> after what Method he muſt treat your Body in your abſence. Whereupon it is adviſable to let you know, that when your Soul ſhall be in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46662:33"/>ſtate of Separation, all things will be carried on in the uſual Road, not only as to Natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but as to thoſe Motions caus'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects; provided that you leave the Machine mounted in the ſame manner, as it is at preſent. So that if you us'd to wake, and riſe at the ſound of an Alarm, or at a certain Hour, as ſoon as that Hour ſhall ſtrike, the Motion of the <hi>Timpanum</hi> of your Ears communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to your Brain, ſhall make way for the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits to glide along the Muſcles, and to produce in your Legs and Arms, and your whole Body, ſuch Motions as daily you your ſelf produc'd, for the taking of your Breeches, then your Doublet, and the reſt of your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, after one an other, and dreſſing you from Head to Foot. It ſhall walk as it us'd to do; traverſe all the Houſe upſtairs, and down. It ſhall ſeat it ſelf at Table, as ſoon as the voice of the Page crying <hi>Dinner Sir is ready,</hi> ſhall ſtrike upon its Ears: It ſhall Eat, ſhall Drink, and in a word, perform every Action it has been accuſtom'd to; the Animal Spirits never failing to take their courſe towards cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts of the Body, at the preſence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Objects, and by conſequence producing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certain Motions in the Body, in certain Circumſtances. Now in all External Actions that we do, there is nothing but Motion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this way. And hence it is that Beaſts who are undoubtedly as Meer Machines as our Body, ſeem to us at the ſame time to act both with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and Uniformity.</p>
            <p>The only Miſchief that you need to fear, is, in caſe a Friend ſhould come to viſit you: Becauſe the Body, without the Soul, would be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46662:33"/>to maintain diſcourſe, and muſt anſwer very impertinent to the Thing in hand. For betwixt our ſelves it is only by Diſcourſe that we <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians</hi> know that thoſe Bodies we commonly call Men, are truly <hi>Men,</hi> and not meerly <hi>Machines:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Let. <hi>53.</hi> de Deſc. Tom. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> But herein it is this <hi>Little Negro</hi> will be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath taught him all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Motions, poſſible to be made upon the Pineal Gland; and all the various Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, of which the Animal Spirits are capable by its means: And how the Words are form'd in the Mouth, only by the motion of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that ſtir the Tongue, the lower Jaw, and Lips: And how particular Words are fram'd, only by the certain Motions of the Muſcles, caus'd by that of the Animal Spirits, according to the different Queſtions, a Friend, ſuppoſe, that gives you a viſit in the abſence of your Soul ſhould propound to you. The <hi>Little Negro</hi> by the various Motions he ſhall then impreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Gland, and, from thence upon the Animal Spirits, and Muſcles, ſhall form with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out failure in your Mouth the Words that ought to be ſpoke, and ſuch Anſwers as the Queſtions ſhall demand. And fear not he ſhould make your Body ſpeak any thing unbecoming of your Soul: For I'll ſay that for him, <hi>Negro</hi> as he is, he is no Fool.</p>
            <p>You may take yet an other way: It is but leaving your Body in the Bed, where it is, and in the Trance you'l put it by the taking Snuſh for the ſeparating of your Soul. That Trance which conſiſts in ſlackning the Senſitive Nerves, is not attended with any further trouble: Mean while, this <hi>little Negro,</hi> ſhall make your Figure, and ſhall ſo exactly Perſonate you, as if your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46662:34"/>Soul had made no expedition: And in that there'l be no difficuty, no more than is in my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Formalities of <hi>a Friar,</hi> and this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's in the ſame Phyſiognomy, and dreſs you us'd to ſee him, as I have but juſt now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd it to you. And to obſerve to you by the by; you ſee the <hi>Carteſian Philoſophy</hi> teaches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Sin, what <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus</hi> and many other <hi>Magicians</hi> could not do, without firſt giving themſelves to the Devil.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Thing you have to do, is, To take a little of the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Snuſh, which he has brought you; ſo we'll hoiſe Sale, and ſtand off for the Road that will bring us to <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes.</hi>

            <p>Having return'd thanks to <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> for the Inſtructions and Light he was pleas'd to give me; I aſſur'd him, as for the firſt Article, I durſt undertake; for that I had all along been ſomewhat <hi>Sceptical</hi> in point of <hi>School-Philoſophy,</hi> and that my Mind was free from the contagion of <hi>Prejudice,</hi> that commonly is caught there: And as to the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Infancy, the reading <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had taught me to diſtruſt them. And that whilſt he was Diſcourſing I had arm'd my ſelf with a freſh Reſolution, of aſſenting to nothing but what I ſhould moſt diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, following <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s advice. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to mention another Reſolution I had made, which was, To fore-arm my ſelf, at leaſt, as much againſt the Opinionativeneſs of the <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> as the <hi>ordinary Philoſophers,</hi> well knowing they were as much conceited as their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Touching his Directions, that reſpected my Body, in my Soul's Abſence, I cloſed with the ſecond Propoſal; Seeing <hi>(ſaid I) Reverent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:46662:34"/>it ſeems more ſimple and feaſible than the former. I like it well <hi>(quoth he)</hi> ſince 'tis one of our <hi>Maxims</hi> in any Syſtem, to chooſe the moſt ſimple way, and that which coſts leaſt Trouble. However, that was not the Reaſon that reſolv'd me, but becauſe I thought therein leſs Danger, and was not ſo firmly perſuaded that my Body would be ſo expert and active in the Abſence of my Soul, as was pretended; and alſo becauſe the Inſtance of Brutes which was urged, made little Impreſſion on my Mind, unable to diſcard thoſe Prejudices a Soul capable of Senſe and Reaſon had confirmed. I deſired <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> to give Orders to the <hi>Little Black to ſute himſelf with my Peſon,</hi> to ſee if it would fit him: Forth with it was done; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held another <hi>me</hi> at my Beds Feet, as the <hi>Soſia of Amphitryon</hi> ſaw another <hi>Soſia</hi> before his Lady's Gate, at his Return from the Camp; only with this Difference, that <hi>I</hi> at my Bed's Feet asked very courteouſly to <hi>me</hi> in the Bed, whereas the <hi>Soſia</hi> who return'd from the Army was well oudgelled by <hi>himſelf Soſia,</hi> who ſtood before the Gate of <hi>Alcmena.</hi> I recommended to him above all the faſt bolting of my Chamber door, that no Body might enter, and the frequent viſiting my Body Day by Day, and admoniſhing him to take Care it might always lye in a Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poſture.</p>
            <p>Upon my <hi>old Sophiſter</hi>'s preſenting me a Doſe of Snuſh, I demanded if it was the True: For I remembred I had heard a Story of one <hi>Apuleius,</hi> that one <hi>Qui pro Quo</hi> metamorphoſed into an Aſs at the ſame Time he expected to become a Bird. He told me, he carried but one ſort, and that there was no Danger of Miſtaking: I then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46662:35"/>preſently took it, and ſneezed (God bleſs me) three or four Times, with mighty Violence. Hereupon I fell into a Swoon, like that of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> I deſcribed before, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant my Soul, by the only Act of the Will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her enlargement from the Body.</p>
            <p>I intend not to enter upon the Retail of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I made upon my Soul, and on my Body, when they were divorced from one another; I will only ſay, I began from that Moment to perceive the Strength of Prejudice and Conceit, in obſtructing the Knowledg of Truth; and how wiſe and rational is the Advice <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> and his Followers give, precautioning us on that Reſpect, and yet at the ſame time, how little Care thoſe Gentlemen had to make uſe of the Rules they preſcribe to others. For the firſt thing <hi>my Gentlemen</hi> would perſuade me, whether I would or not, was, that my Soul in the inſtant of Separation, ſaw herſelf ſeated on the <hi>pineal Gland.</hi> As I judged it unfitting to begin with them by a palpable Contradiction; I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Separation was performed ſo heedleſly, I had no Time to make that Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What I ſaid was true, and was alſo the leaſt diſobliging Anſwer I could find; for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly remembred, and was throughly convinc'd of what I had lately read in <hi>M. Stenon</hi> the great Anatomiſt, who was a great admirer of <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> and look'd upon him as the ingenious Contriver of a <hi>Novel Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anatomie du cerveau.</note> but ſhew'd and prov'd by ocular Demonſtration, this <hi>Man</hi> of his a quite different Creature from <hi>that</hi> which God Created: And that the <hi>pineal Gland</hi> has not the Situation, much leſs is capable of thoſe Motions attributed to it, upon that <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46662:35"/>Veſſels with which it is encompaſſed, are not Arteries, which might ſupply it with the Matter of the Animal Spirits, as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſuppoſes; but only Veins, that by conſequence the Honour and Priviledge it has given it, of being the Cloſet of the Soul, is without Foundation; and that perhaps it deſerves not to be advanced (upon any more conſiderable Employ it has) above the other Glands, whoſe Office is uſually of no great Importance in an <hi>Animal Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were my Thoughts, though I kept them to my ſelf; and I was deſirous, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to accompany them in their Sentiments. I firſt obſerved to them how Digeſtion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in my Body, though my Soul was abſent, by the only Vertue of that <hi>Acid Humor</hi> in the Stomach, which, by the Agitation of its inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Parts, diſſolves Meats no otherwiſe than <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> diſſolves Metals: How the moſt ſubtle Parts, ſeparated from one another, made a Cream-like Liquor, called the <hi>Chyle:</hi> How the <hi>Periſtaltique</hi> Motion of the Guts ſerved to drive down the groſſer Parts, and to give admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the <hi>Chyle</hi> into the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> through the imperceptible Pores, proportioned to the Figure of the Particles the <hi>Chyle</hi>'s compoſed of: How upon the Heats ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Heart, juſt as before, the Blood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed its circular uſual Courſe, continuing all the conſequent Effects, ſuch as Nutrition, and the ſound Conſtitution of the Limbs, placed at the greateſt Diſtance: How, in ſhort all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were carried on, by the only <hi>Clockwork</hi> of the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the Sticklers for the old Philoſophy muſt not reſent the Compliance I uſed on this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46662:36"/>Occaſion; for if all that was abſolutely falſe, it could never have been true in this preſent Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſeeing my Body was not corrupted, tho' my Soul had left it; but if the Motion and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Humours once had ceaſed, it muſt of neceſſity have been corrupted: Whence it follows, That ſuppoſing my Soul ſeparate from my Body, as I do then ſuppoſe it was, it is plain that all the Motions were performed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed only by their Dependance on the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt we thought of ſetting out: I ask'd then what Names and Titles of Dignity or Reſpect Souls uſed to treat each other with in their Spiritual Converſation; for that Souls being in <hi>French</hi> of the Feminine Gender, I was guilty all-a-long of an Abſurdity, in calling the Soul of <hi>M.</hi> by the Name of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> yet I durſt not uſe <hi>Madam</hi> nor <hi>Mademoiſelle.</hi> As for you (<hi>ſaid I to</hi> Father Merſennus<hi>'s Soul</hi>) I may eaſe my ſelf of that Trouble for the future, by uſing <hi>your Reverence;</hi> ſo you may, ſaid he, by addreſſing M—s Soul with <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> both Titles <hi>are all-a-mode</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and arriv'd from thence in <hi>France.</hi> But trouble not your Head about it, we continue the ſame Names we had in the World when in our Bodies, <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> is <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſtill; this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is what he was before; I am called <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> as you are <hi>M</hi>—, for we <hi>Carteſians</hi> are a little <hi>Platonical</hi> in the Buſineſs. With <hi>Plato</hi> what's a Man? He's a Soul that makes uſe of a Body: And you may call to Mind a Particular Paſſage among others in <hi>Carteſius his Method,</hi> where he ſays, <q>Examining with Attention what I was, and that I could conceive my Body to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46662:36"/>thing—and on the contrary, if I did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a Moment without thinking, I had no Reaſon to believe I had an Exiſtence in that Moment— I conceived I was a thing, or a Subſtance, whoſe whole Nature and Eſſence did meerly conſiſt in thinking; ſo that my ſelf (I mean my Soul, by whoſe means only I am, what I am) my ſelf, I ſay, is a thing wholly diſtinct from my Body.</q> And I wonder (<hi>added</hi> Father Merſennus) the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>School-Divines</hi> have eſcaped this Paſſage, and have not before this ranked it in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his pretended Errors; eſpecially ſince <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> reflected on it by the by. But let's be gone, ſaid he, and let's make haſte, we have loſt a whole half Hour already; Time's very precious: And with that he Soars up in the Air with the Soul of the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> and I without any more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, ſet out to follow them.</p>

            <head>A VOYAGE TO <hi>The World of Carteſius.</hi> PART. II.</head>
            <p>THE Weather was very ſerene, the Air extreamly clear, the Moon was in the Full, and the Stars glittered, methought, in an extraordinary manner, which made me wonderful impatient to contemplate thoſe Glorious Bodies more nigh them, whoſe Splendor, Vaſtneſs, Number and Order have been thought a Subject of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by all Ages, the worthieſt Object of the Study and Meditation of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and moſt ſenſible Proof of the <hi>Divinity;</hi> notwithſtanding which, my Guides cauſed me to make a Halt upon the Pinnacle of a Tower, raiſed far above
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46662:37"/>the reſt of the Town, to obſerve the Nature of the Air of that low Region, and the Parts of which it is compoſed. Come on <hi>(ſays my old Gentleman)</hi> you ſhall know by your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the Truth of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> his Sentiments, in the Explication of Natural Beings. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what he ſays in his <hi>fourth Book of Principles,</hi> that the Air is only an Amaſs of branched and ragged Parts, of the <hi>third Element,</hi> extreamly ſmall, ſever'd from one another, and floating in the middle of the Balls of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> whoſe Motions they obey. See how the Parts of the <hi>Firſt Element</hi> are mingled through the whole, and fill up all the Intervals the little Globules and the branch'd Parts leave betwixt them; how the Fluidity of this Body, as well as all other we call Liquids, conſiſts in the Motion of its inſenſible Parts, which have an indifferent Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to any Side; for being they are all in Motion, and have moſtly quite different Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, we may readily conceive two things: Firſt, That upon a Liquid Body's ceaſing to be confined and bounded by a Solid one, it muſt diffuſe itſelf on every Side, ſince it's Parts are in a Motion every way. Secondly, That upon a ſolid Body's offering to paſs through, finding all the Parts in Motion, it eaſily makes a Separation; ſince, to do this, 'tis only requiſite to give them different Determinations inſtead of thoſe they had before; it being certain that when Bodies, and eſpecially ſmall ones, are in Motion, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo different as that in which the little Parts are found, 'tis the eaſieſt thing in Nature to give them new Determinations, and by conſequence to divide a Liquid Body, and paſs through it. Theſe two Phaenomena's then of a Liquid
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46662:38"/>Body, being explain'd ſo cleverly and ſo intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly as you ſee they are, by the <hi>Principles</hi> of Phioſophy; the <hi>Gentlemen Philoſophers of the Schools</hi> would have a great Sway over my Mind, if they would oblige me to acknowledge Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity for an abſolute Accident, diſtinguiſh'd from the Motion of the Inſenſible Parts of a Liquid Body.</p>
            <p>As much inclined as I was to defend the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the <hi>old Philoſophy,</hi> I muſt own this Reaſoning, joyned with that I ſaw my ſelf, made great Impreſſion on my Mind; for though I could perceive no ſuch Thing as the little Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> of which he talk'd, and which was a meer Illuſion of a Soul intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, as much as poſſible, with the <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> of <hi>Carteſianiſm;</hi> yet I was forced to Acknowledg in the Air thoſe little inſenſible Parts looſe and diſingaged of one another, that undoubtedly conſtitute all Liquid Bodies. I plainly ſaw that <hi>ſubtle Matter</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf acknowledged under the Name of <hi>Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Matter, and taught to be diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, in a moſt rapid Motion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I could not diſallow that plain Explication he had made of the Properties of a Liquid Body: And I muſt grant, That were <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> as reaſonable in all its Parts as this, I might be a little tempted to turn <hi>Carteſian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling my ſelf to diſpute the Globules with him of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> or offering ſuch other Doubts and Scruples as then came into my Mind; with entire Submiſſion I complemented upon all the reſt, both theſe Companions of my <hi>Voyage;</hi> that is to ſay, upon the <hi>ſubtle Matter,</hi> and on that <hi>branchy Matter,</hi> which I termed in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46662:38"/>their Language without more ado, the <hi>Matter of the Firſt and Third Element.</hi> I much applauded their Explication of Fluidity, and commended it for its Neatneſs and Simplicity; but a little Adventure turned the Diſcourſe, and had like to have ſpoiled the Fruit of all my former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſance.</p>
            <p>There was on the top of the Tower on which we lighted, a kind of a Twirl that was in the Nature of a Weather-Cock, about ſeven Inches Diameter; its Subſtance was of Plate of Steel, very thin and light; its Sails were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly equal, and the Pin on which it turn'd, ſmooth and poliſh'd: So that the gentleſt Gale of Wind ſet it a going, and at the ſame time turn'd about a bent Iron Rod (for the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point of the Wind) whoſe end made the Axis to the Twirl. It fortun'd that a <hi>Soldier</hi> of a <hi>Suitz</hi> Regiment that quartered in the Town, diſcharg'd his Musket in the Air: It was loaded with two Bullets, one of which as it flew, but juſt glanc'd upon the end of one of the Flyers of the Twirl: And yet impreſs'd ſo conſiderable a Motion as laſted a long time. The Bullet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd its Motion almoſt in a right Line, and went very near as far and as ſwift, as the other Bullet that never touch'd upon the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock. I had good Reaſon to take notice of that laſt Circumſtance. <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> ſlipt not that occaſion to demonſtrate to me another of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles. You ſee <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> theſe Flyers; if that Ball had not ſlanted upon one of them in paſſing, ſeeing there is not any breeze of Wind, do you think they would have left that quiet Poſture they were in, and turn'd themſelves about? No certainly <hi>(I reply'd.)</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46662:39"/>The poſture they were in a Moment ſince, could never have been chang'd for that they are in at preſent, but by the aſſiſtance of ſome External Cauſe that has made that alteration. But now <hi>(added he)</hi> that they are in a directly contrary State, do you believe they could quit the ſame, without the determination of ſome other Cauſe that ſhould deſtroy their Motion, as the Bullet did their Reſt? <hi>Father (ſaid I)</hi> that Queſtion ſeems more difficult than the other to reſolve: I have heard it always held, as an unqueſtionable Axiom, That every Body, whilſt it is in Motion, tends to its Repoſe as to its end. We'll grant you <hi>(reply'd he)</hi> that Philoſophick Banterage every Body, whilſt in Motion, has a tendency to reſt, as to its end. A Body is endu'd with Reaſon and a Will, firſt to have an end, and then to make unto it. But if that Propoſition is capable of receiving any tolerable meaning, it ſays no more than this, That in the ſituation and diſpoſition Bodies have among themſelves in the World, ſenſible Bodies that are mov'd do truly loſe their Motion by Degrees, upon the oppoſition they receive from other Bodies, to which it is communicated, and at length they reſt. For if nothing did deſtroy that State of Motion it would laſt for ever, by the ſame Rule, that if nothing did diſturb the reſt of a Body, it would always remain immoveable. And this it is of which I had a deſire to convince you, by the Example of this little Wind-mill, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has preſented us.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing this Gimcrack had turn'd in the midſt of Water, as it does in the midſt of Air, it is a plain Caſe, it's Motion would quickly have been deſtroy'd by the great Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46662:39"/>the Water would have made. If two of its Sails had been longer, larger and heavier, than the other two, the Motion had ceas'd ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yet: Becauſe that inequality would have been another Cauſe of a more forcible Reſiſtance. Again, if you add to this, that the Pin on which it turns had been thicker, as alſo ruſty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſh'd, the Motion had been loſt ſtill ſooner, for the ſame Reaſon. But becauſe it ſtands in Air, and in Air that's very fine; becauſe it Sails are exactly pois'd, and its <hi>Axis</hi> ſlender, ſmooth and poliſh'd, the Reſiſtance that it finds is leſs, and the Motion ſo much greater, and longer it will laſt. Whence we may thus conclude: Much Reſiſtance deſtroys much Motion; a leſs Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance deſtroys leſs; and a leſſer yet, deſtroys a leſſer Motion ſtill; and ſo on: Hence, if there was no Reſiſtance at all, the Motion would not flag, but continue always; hence as a Body would maintain its Reſt, unleſs an external Cauſe diſturbed it in the Poſſeſſion of that State, ſo a Body would continue its Motion, as long as it ſhould meet no Moleſtation in it. So then, the great Principle of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> is eſtabliſh'd, That a Body of its own Nature ſtays always in the Capacity it is plac'd; if it is at reſt 'twil always reſt; if it is of a Triangular Figure it will be of a Triangular Figure always; if it is in Motion it will for ever be ſo: But for the reſt this Principle is not peculiar to <hi>Deſcartes, Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> before him, <hi>Gaſſendus, Hobbes, Maignan,</hi> &amp;c. ſuppoſe it true. And I remember likewiſe, That in making my <hi>Collections</hi> for my <hi>Commentaries upon</hi> Geneſis, where I have introduced an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of <hi>Philological, Philoſophical</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomical Diſſertations,</hi> I have remarked more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46662:40"/>than one Place in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where he either teaches or ſuppoſes the ſame Doctrin; and <hi>Vaſques</hi> one of the ſubtleſt of the <hi>School Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> has proved it at large, as to the concern of Motion: It may however be ſaid, that no one ever carried it to that Pitch, and uſed it ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly, and with that Advantage as <hi>Deſcartes;</hi> and thence it was that particular Difference and Honour was paid him rather than to others upon that reſpect.</p>
            <p>I am much of your Opinion <hi>(I returned,)</hi> That General Principle is without Controverſie one of thoſe, the Mind of Man admits without offering Violence to itſelf; and the Difficulty that is found in applying it to Bodies, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Motion, proceeds only from that falſe Idea, ſo commonly received, of what we call <hi>Modes</hi> in Philoſophy, and from our conceiting Motion as a <hi>poſitive being,</hi> and Reſt as <hi>its Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> though neither Motion is a Being, nor Reſt the Privation of a Being, but one and the other are different and contrary States, of which a Body Natural is capable. But, <hi>Reverend Father,</hi> this Whirl-gig here has raiſed a Scruple in me, of which I'd fain diſcharge my Conſcience; it is grounded on another Principle of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> concerning which you may call to mind, if you pleaſe, that the Ball that touch'd the Sail, ſeeing it but glanced upon it, loſt nothing, or next to nothing of its Motion, that it had ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and we ſaw it arrive to its Journey's End as ſoon as (at leaſt was but a Trice behind hand with) the other that never touched at all; and on the other Hand impreſſed a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Motion on the Engine: For whether we meaſure the Quantity of the Motion, by the Bulk
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46662:40"/>Compaſs of the Body moved; or whether we meaſure it by the largeneſs of the Space traverſed by the Body, in thoſe innumerable Circles it deſcribed, ſpight of the Reſiſtance of the <hi>medium</hi> wherein it turned: Or likewiſe whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſwiftneſs of the Motion, it is manifeſt the Ball communicated much more Motion to the other Body than it loſt itſelf: And on the contrary, granting the ſuppoſition you have juſt made unto my Hands, to demonſtrate a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Deſcartes;</hi> I mean, that the Sails had been unequally ballanc'd, and of a different Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the <hi>Axle</hi> had been Groſs, unſmooth, or ruſty, and that the Ball had grazed on one of the Sails leſs obliquely than it did, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in theſe Circumſtances the Ball had loſt much more of its ſwiftneſs and its Motion, yet would have impreſs'd or communicated much leſs than it hath at preſent. What now's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe grand Principles of <hi>M. Deſcartes?</hi> that a Body at the ſame inſtant that it moves another, communicates exactly ſo much Motion to it as it loſes, and preciſely loſes the ſame Quantity it communicates; for here the Bullet communicates a great deal, but loſes little; and in the other Suppoſition it loſes much, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates but little: What now becomes of thoſe mighty <hi>Axioms</hi> that lay the Foundation of his <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> and ſupport the whole Frame and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his <hi>World?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. <hi>2.</hi> prine. p. <hi>37.</hi> let. <hi>72.</hi> tom. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> That God in the Creation of the World, or Matter, created at the ſame Time in it a definite Quantity of Motion, or <hi>Tranſport</hi> (as he himſelf ſtyles it) from one Place to another, which is always the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Increaſe or Diminution, although the Parts of which the World's compoſed, have ſometimes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46662:41"/>more and ſometimes leſs of it; foraſmuch as what is loſt in me, is of Neceſſity received into another: That God is the univerſal Cauſe of all the Motion in the World: That the Creatures have no Pretence to its Production, and can only determine that produced already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if a Body communicates more than it has in it ſelf, God or the Body it ſelf muſt needs produce the <hi>overplus</hi> of the new; and if a Body loſes more than it communicates, that which is loſt and not communicated, muſt of neceſſity be annihilated. And this is ſufficient to demonſtrate that the Quantity of Motion is not always the ſame in the World, but on the contrary it increaſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes every Moment. In a Word, we ſee here a conſiderable Part of Matter put into a rapid Motion that before had none at all. I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> and that a little thing would turn the Scales; that will not do our Buſineſs, it will ſtill be true to ſay, there is a new <hi>Tranſport</hi> communicated to a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Matter: That that Tranſport is no ſmall one, ſince it carries a great deal of Matter through a great deal of Space; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ball hath not loſt the leaſt imaginable, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is carried as far, and as ſwift, within a Trifle, as it would have been if it had communicated none at all. But that which ſeemed of moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance was, the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, that was intereſſed in this Affair: For the Reaſon why <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was ſo zealous to preſerve the ſame Quantity of Motion to a Grain, was becauſe God's unchangable. See where this Trifle now has led us? But what a Miſchief would it be, if this petty Inſtance overturning the Principle of the Quantity of Motion, ſhould ſhatter all thoſe

               <hi>Seven</hi> fine <hi>Rules</hi> of Motion <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with ſo exact a Calculation? Mean while they all take it for granted, and ſubſiſt but on the Courteſie of that Suppoſition; however he makes no Scruple to conclude his Explication with this remarkable Paſſage, <hi>All this is ſo evident it needs no Demonſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to loſe Time in drawing other Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, methinks, my <hi>Reverend Father,</hi>

               </note> of avoiding, above all things, a too heady for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in his Determinations, and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing any Principle, without examining of it with all poſſible Diligence, and upon greater Evidence than the moſt palpable Demonſtrations in Geometry afford; of having ſo ſtrict an Eye in every thing, and of making ſo exact an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis</hi> of all the Propoſitions he advanc'd, that he might be certain nothing could eſcape him; for had he guarded himſelf with theſe Precautions, before he propoſed his Doctrin concerning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your <hi>Wind-mill,</hi> and an hundred Inſtances might have come in to his Head, and probably have altered his Opinion, at leaſt prevented him from ſaying, <hi>Theſe things were all ſo evident they ſeemed to need no Demonſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I foreſaw that this Diſcourſe would not reliſh well with my Companions; and I am ſure <hi>my old Blade</hi> began already to repent him of his Vouching for me to <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that with an implicit head-ſtrong Reſolution embraced <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi> The <hi>Good Father</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gently reply'd, That he had obſerved three
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46662:42"/>Things in my Diſcourſe, a little Malignity in my Reflections, abundance of falſe <hi>Prejudice</hi> that ſtill ſtuck by me, whatever Aſſurance I had given to the contrary, and ſome Difficulties at the Bottom, for the clearing of which it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to diſcourſe <hi>Carteſius:</hi> But let them <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> ſeem as Big and as Frightful as they can, they will preſently diſappear, upon his converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you; I have experienced it an hundred Times. No Man was ever more troubleſome to him in Queſtions than my ſelf, which I us'd to make on all Occaſions, even 'till I wearied him. Theſe Difficulties once I thought inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; but one Letter, of about a Page he wrote me, diſperſed all my Doubts, and gave me more Light into the Matters then in Hand, than the entire Volumes of other Men. I much expected the Reproach of Prejudice, for that's the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Refuge of <hi>Carteſius,</hi> and the Gentlemen his Diſciples, when they find themſelves preſs'd a little home: I urged however that Point no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him; I only excuſed my ſelf from the Malignity he charged upon my Reflections, and upon the Hopes he gave me of the Solution of my Difficulties by <hi>M. Deſcartes, (I rejoyn'd)</hi> You exceedingly rejoyce me, Reverend Father, for I am a Carteſian in my Heart, though I am not a through pac'd one in my Mind, wanting ſufficient Light to extricate, my Doubts, which the Reading the Books of that Great Man has raiſed in me; but I have a ſincere Love for Truth, and aſſure your ſelf, I ſhall wholly reſign my ſelf up unto her, ſo ſoon as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſhall preſent her to me.</p>
            <p>After that Proteſtation, which ſeemed a little to reinſtate me in their good Oponion, we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46662:42"/>launch'd again: And it will not be amiſs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe my Reader here, this once for all, That whatever Room theſe Harangues and Diſputes take up upon the Paper, they laſted but one ſingle inſtant, ſince ſeparate Spirits entertain each other a quite different way from that they uſe when in the Body, whoſe Tongue pronounces but one Syllable at a Time; one Spiritual Word that a Separate Soul ſhall ſpeak unto another Soul, is more full and expreſſive than a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced or written: And ſince my taking of this <hi>Voyage</hi> I have made a World of fine Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, for the explaining the Way that Angels diſcourſe together; I queſtion not but to be in Print ſome Time or other upon that Occaſion: I confeſs I ſhall ſpeak many Things that for want of Uſe will not be underſtood; but my <hi>Book</hi> may find no leſs a Welcome and Eſteem for that, but rather the good Fortune Books of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Divinity</hi> have met with, that have been for ſome Time the only ones in Faſhion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended meerly by their being unintelligible to thoſe that read them, and pretending to be underſtood by the Compoſers; for it is known by too manifeſt Experience, the Authors of thoſe Books are not always ſuch mighty Saints as they would ſeem.</p>
            <p>We parted then from the Top of the Tower, before the Inſtrument deſiſted from its turning, and we ſteered towards the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon:</hi> My Soul perceived an unſpeakable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſcud it in the Air, and to wander in thoſe vaſt Spaces, ſhe could only travel with the Eye before, when united with the Body; that minded me of a former Delight I had ſometime taſted in my Sleep, in dreaming that I whipt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46662:43"/>through the Air, without ever touching Ground, above which I thought my ſelf exalted many Yards.</p>
            <p>We met upon the Road vaſt Troops of Separate Souls, of all Nations, <hi>Laplanders, Finlanders,</hi>

               <hi>Brachmans;</hi> and I then remembred what I had read in ſeveral Books, That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of ſeparating the Soul and Body was known among thoſe People. But about fifty Leagues on this ſide that Planet, there is a Region very well ſtock'd, eſpecially with <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Stoicks</hi> for the generality: And quite from that Place to my Arrival at the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> I deſcryed how ſwingingly Hiſtory belies an infinite Number of Perſons, that it ſuppoſes dead, like other Men; though, in truth, they are no more Dead than <hi>M. Deſcartes himſelf.</hi> I ſhall diſcourſe with ſome of them as I go along.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> has an Atmoſphere like the Earth, that by a moderate Computation may amount to three French Leagues in height. As we were juſt ready to ſtrike Sail, we made a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us, three Souls that held a very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conference together; we judged they might be Souls of Conſequence, by the deference many others in their Retinue ſeemed to pay them: Upon our enquiring who they were, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they were <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that were met in Conſult, for the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; for that being adviſed by certain News from <hi>our World,</hi> That the <hi>Venetians</hi> had beaten the <hi>Turks,</hi> not only out of <hi>Ancient Peloponeſus,</hi> but alſo the Famous City of <hi>Athens,</hi> where here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore theſe three Philoſophers had made ſo great a Figure; they had reſolved in their Debate,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46662:43"/>ſo ſoon as any <hi>Noble Venetian</hi>'s Soul ſhould arrive in theſe Quarters, to petition her to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Intereſt to <hi>General Moriſini</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>'s Conſideration; To require the replacing the Statues the <hi>Athenians</hi> had erected to them; To re-eſtabliſh the Academy and the <hi>Lyceum</hi> with all their Priviledges, and to reſtore the Marbles in the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> whereon was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Juſtification of <hi>Socrates,</hi> with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations charged on <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi> his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: And in caſe they ſhould puſh their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts as far as <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to have as great regard for <hi>Stagyra,</hi> at preſent <hi>Liba nova,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had formerly on the account of his Maſter <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whoſe Country that was. I am ſurprized, ſays <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> to ſee theſe <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> I never heard any Mention of them here, nor did I ever meet them in all my Travels: It is true, I have obſerved in my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon</hi> Geneſis, That <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus</hi> uſed to quit their Bodies, the better to contemplate the Sovereign Good; and that <hi>Socrates,</hi> as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> relates in <hi>Plato,</hi> had from Time to Time ſuch ſort of Extaſies: 'Tis true alſo, I never took <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for ſo great a Fool as to throw himſelf headlong into <hi>Euripes,</hi> for the Madneſs and Deſpair of being unable to comprehend the <hi>Flux and Reflux of the Sea:</hi> And many things I have read in that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to ſuſpect he knew the Myſtery of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; but I never thought to inform my ſelf whether theſe Gentlemen made uſe of it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Dying. You'll ſee <hi>(he added)</hi> that as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> has determined to put the Project of his <hi>World</hi> in Execution, that he framed while he lived on Earth, ſo <hi>Plato</hi> will reſolve upon the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46662:44"/>Undertaking that of his <hi>Republick,</hi> which we ſhall ſee fix'd ſomewhere in thoſe Vaſt and Deſart Spaces above the Heavens, where he will convoy a Colony of Separate Souls, to conſtitute his Government.</p>
            <p>That ſuppoſed <hi>(ſaid my old Gentleman) Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> had but ill Intelligence from the other World, ſince in his <hi>Dialogues of the Dead</hi> he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten talks of <hi>Socrates</hi> as a Man that had paſſed the <hi>Stygian-Lake</hi> in <hi>Caron</hi>'s Boat, and as an old Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of <hi>Hell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nouveaux Dial. des Mor.</note> But what, Gentlemen <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> do you ſay of our Modern <hi>Lucian,</hi> I mean the Author of the <hi>New Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> that without farther Ceremony places <hi>Monſieur Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> and brings him on the Stage diſcourſing with the pretended <hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy?</hi> Is it reaſonable to think, That Author, upon his entertaining us in that Work with ſome pretty Things, and diverting us with an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of choice Hiſtorical Obſervations, to think, I ſay, under that Shelter he had Right to put off all the Frolicks of his Imagination, without any regard to Truth? To place <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> at the ſame Time he's above the <hi>Heavens,</hi> is not this (to expreſs my ſelf in the Quodlibetique Style of our Friend <hi>M——</hi>) <hi>Aberrare toto Coelo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the interim we ſaw the three <hi>Philoſophers</hi> advance towards us: 'Tis known they were three of the fineſt Gentlemen, that have bore that Character in Antiquity, and that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been diſtinguiſh'd from that Raſcality of <hi>Sophiſts</hi> and <hi>Cynicks</hi> that generally were meer <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and only purchaſed the Reputation of Sages at the Expence of the moſt abuſive Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances. <hi>Socrates</hi> made the Addreſs, and in a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46662:44"/>moſt obliging manner told us: He eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived we were of <hi>France,</hi> not only becauſe we came that Road, but alſo that he ſaw in us the Character and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Nation; which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was the moſt polite at preſent in the World; that though he had but little Commerce with <hi>our World,</hi> he had yet enough to be certified of that Particular. He demanded the Occaſion of our <hi>Voyage,</hi> and where we were a going.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> took the Word, and made anſwer, We were upon a Viſit to a Friend of ours, that lived at a vaſt Diſtance; that we were happy in timing our <hi>Voyage</hi> ſo exactly, as to have the Opportunity of paying our moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſpects to thoſe <hi>Perſonages,</hi> that have given Renown and Glory to Antiquity, and whoſe Names after the Tract of two thouſand Years were ſtill acknowledged and held Venerable by all the Nations in the Earth.</p>
            <p>'Tis believed below we are dead, ſaid <hi>Socrates;</hi> True (<hi>replyed</hi> Father Merſennus) and I my ſelf was guilty of that Univerſal Miſtake: But here are <hi>two Gentlemen (continued he)</hi> meaning us, that are ſtill Inhabitants of the <hi>lower World,</hi> and who will undeceive it as to that Particular. I ſhall not be ſorry, for my part, anſwered he; and it would not be amiſs to acquaint the People there, That the Soul of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> ſuch as I am, ſtaid not to be diſmiſſed from the World by the Decree of a Faction of Corrupt Judges, and the Clamours of a Multitude, incenſed by the Envy and Buffoonry, of a Coxcomb of a <hi>Comedian.</hi> Hear the State of the Matter; well knowing the Rage and Popularity of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I thought it not worth while to ſtay, but quitting my Body, I gave Orders to my <hi>Familiar
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46662:45"/>Spirit,</hi> to enter in my Room, and to put a good Face upon the Buſineſs to the End; being more Secure of his Performance than my own, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Conſtancy and Reſolvedneſs I found in my ſelf. He acted his part to a Tittle; and I ſcarce think 'tis yet forgotten in the World, what Conſtancy appeared both in my Looks and Words, when the Sentence of my Death was heard pronounced; with what Undauntedneſs I was ſeen to take from the Executioner the Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock-potion that poiſoned my Body, and the Fury of my Accuſers, that were ready to burſt with Malice, to ſee me a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> to the laſt. It is true <hi>(I replyed)</hi> that laſt Action of your Life has procured you a vaſt eſteem among Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to this Day, and I queſtion whether it will make for your Glory, for us to publiſh the true Matter of the Fact, as you have related it. No matter <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I have ſtill a greater Love for Truth than my own Glory, and am more concerned for <hi>Her</hi> than for <hi>my ſelf.</hi> Moſt bravely anſwered <hi>(I cry'd)</hi> and worthy of your ſelf; That one Sentence is worth all the Oration your <hi>Demon</hi> harangued your Friends with, to comfort them in your Death, and I am reſolved it ſhall loſe nothing of its Value in the Carriage. If one fine Wit of our World had but heard it, he would certainly have canonized you for't; he, I ſay, that in reading your Story, was much put to't to forbear an Invocation, and crying <hi>Sancte</hi> Socrates <hi>ora pro nobis</hi> (That Extravagance is known to be <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s, and <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf thought it very impertinent.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> next obliged us to diſabuſe the World of thoſe falſe Reports, that were current of his Death; ſome making him dye of the Colick;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46662:45"/>others affirming he poiſoned himſelf; others again, That he drowned himſelf in <hi>Euripus;</hi> theſe laſt came neareſt to the Truth. He told us then, That being diſgraced, and baniſhed from the <hi>Court,</hi> upon Suſpicion he was dipt in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Caliſthene,</hi> his Friend, againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> he retreated to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he opened his School of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> That he was there impeached of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> as groundleſsly as <hi>Socrates,</hi> by a <hi>Prieſt of Ceres;</hi> which obliged him to retire to <hi>Calcis:</hi> That one Day as he was taking a Turn upon the Bank of <hi>Euripus,</hi> and recollecting in his Mind the glorious Advantages he had loſt, of making his Fortune, ſeeing all his Hopes unravelled, that he was for ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded from the <hi>Court,</hi> and diſcharged from <hi>Athens,</hi> the Melancholy that ſeiz'd him made him reſolve to leave the World; that, to that intent, he made uſe of the Secret <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> had left him, from whom he had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to deſcend in a Right Line by his Father <hi>Nicomachus,</hi> formerly Phyſician to his Majeſty King <hi>Amyntas,</hi> the Grand-Father of <hi>Alexander;</hi> he made uſe of it, I ſay, to ſeparate himſelf from's Body, which he left in a Place where the Sea, in a high Tide, chanced to carry it off. Upon the finding of his Body drowned, every one made his Conjecture: The Court, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what Impreſſion Diſgrace would make upon the Spirit of a Courtier, whoſe Nature it is, more than may be ſuppoſed, upon Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſpatch themſelves out of the World, concluded very rationally on the Point; but the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Diſciples</hi> carried it. At that Time he was about explaining the Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon of the <hi>Flux and Reflux</hi> of the Seas: He
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46662:46"/>had confeſs'd contrary to his cuſtom, that he did not throughly apprehend it: And that vex'd him to the heart. Thence they readily concluded <hi>that</hi> the cauſe of his deſpair. One of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently proclaim'd it in ſeveral parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> And as if he had been behind him, when he threw himſelf in the water, added the words he ſpoke unto the Sea, juſt upon his jump; <hi>Since I can not comprehend thee, thou ſhalt comprehend me.</hi> The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> ſeem'd very pretty. That gave Legs to the report, and by that Paſſ-port it arriv'd to us.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething ſtrange and new in theſe Particulars as well as in the Story of <hi>Socrates.</hi> And many of the Circumſtances are left out in moſt of the Authours that have treated on this Subject. That encourages me to hope they'l meet with a kind Entertainment from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; ſince tis this that now a days lifts our Hiſtorians unto Reputation, and ſets 'em above the common herd of Writers: And nothing takes ſo much as Paradox in Hiſtory; ſince a Manuſcript that ſhall thwart the long receiv'd Opinions of Mankind, is the only piece in faſhion, eſpecially if ſlanderous and invective, and the Extracts ſent to the <hi>Compilers of the Holland-Journals,</hi> and the <hi>News of the Republick of Learning</hi> to advance the Rate of theſe Books, are fill'd with hardly any thing but rare and admirable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. But tis not on the faith of <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> I ground my Reports, things commonly ſubject to be queſtion'd, but on the Teſtimony of the Perſons mainly concern'd in the Hiſtory, and who have either done or ſuffer'd the thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in related. And I challenge all the <hi>Burnets in England</hi> to evince me falſe in any thing, by all the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of the Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:46662:46"/>
            <p>As for <hi>Plato,</hi> he told us, It did not ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Head, what were the Sentiments of Men concerning him, and thank't us for the offers of our Service that we made him: But Experience convinc'd us of the truth of <hi>Father Merſennus</hi>'s conjecture, touching the <hi>Republick;</hi> and alſo that had his <hi>Reverence</hi> been a little more converſant in the Affairs of the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> he would have made no wonder at his finding <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thereabouts; ſince the firſt had effectually eſtabliſh'd his <hi>Republick</hi> there, and the ſecond his <hi>Lyceum,</hi> both which we ſee geographically deſcrib'd in the Mapps of that Country by <hi>Father Grimaldus</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cartes Seleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> one of the Notableſt Mathematicians of the Age. We have nothing of certainty as to <hi>Socrates</hi>'s abode; but 'tis more than probable his ordinary Reſort is in his belov'd Diſciple <hi>Plato</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>After this little Entercourſe, as we were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave of theſe Gentlemen, <hi>Socrates</hi> demanded what Friend it was we went ſo for to wait on? <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> anſwer'd, that it was <hi>Deſcartes: Deſcartes! (reply'd Ariſtotle:)</hi> What that mad Blade that came from the other World above thirty years ago? He that was made the Owl of all the Philoſophers, not able to endure him here, and that forc't him to ſeek out for other Quarters! Truly a very pretty Fellow, that to have treated me ſo Bully-like, and with that diſdain I am told he did: Me, I ſay, that have been the <hi>Tutour</hi> to the greateſt <hi>Prince</hi> and greateſt <hi>Conquerour</hi> that ever was! Me, to whoſe Honour <hi>Philippe</hi> and <hi>Olympias</hi> erected Statues! Me, that have taught <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> that have wrote ſo many <hi>Books</hi> and had a whole <hi>Regiment</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours!</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:46662:47"/>Me whoſe Words had paſs'd ſo long for Oracle, and the deciſions of the Schools; Me, in fine, that all the Philoſophers plume them ſelves as having gain'd unto their Party, and not willing, nor indeed daring to confeſs, I take the contrary ſide! I would fain ſee that bold Merchant venture on the Benches. I have ſeen his Books and pity 'em. Would you gueſs <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> turning haſtily to <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> what is the firſt ſtep he would have his <hi>Wiſe men</hi> make, in order to his ſafer conduct to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth?

For my par't, I'd only ask the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man one Queſtion, Does he ſuppoſe a Man can doubt of every thing, or does he not? If not, Why makes he it the leading precepts of his <hi>Method?</hi> For in point of Precept and Method, 'tis neceſſary they be ſuch as can be put in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.<note place="margin">In Synopſi Medit.</note> If he does ſuppoſe it, how is it he more than once mantains in his <hi>Meditations,</hi> and his <hi>Method,</hi> that the arguments of the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> which were next a kin to thoſe he brings to fetter us in doubts, were never capable of ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſingle perſon,<note place="margin">Rep. aux Inſt. de Gaſſend.</note> that was in his Senſes as to thoſe apparent Truths?

Or does he imagine that the Arguments of the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> would be more effectual in his Mouth, or in his Writings than in theirs, whoſe only Deſign, for the generality, was to torture and plague the other <hi>Sophiſts</hi> and to make themſelves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46662:47"/>ſport with thoſe as ſhould indeavour ſeriouſly to confute them? But never dream'd of one <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Deſcartes</hi> that ſhould one time or other Martial their <hi>Sophiſms</hi> in the Van of his <hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſuppoſing <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had induc'd me to doubt that Two and Three made Five; and that the Whole was bigger than its Part; I would fain know what Method he would take to rid me of this doubt, and to replace me in the <hi>Statu quo</hi> of certainty where I was before? This could not be done without the aid of another Propoſition, more evident than the other; which muſt ſerve to convince me, that what I began to doubt, was undoubtedly, not to be doubted of. Now what is with him that high and mighty Propoſition, that muſt brandiſh its Light on all the reſt, and act the Sun among the other Stars? Why: I <hi>think, therefore I am.</hi> For, ſays he, 'tis impoſſible to think unleſs I am. Moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably condluded! And is it leſs impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Two and Three ſhould not be Five; that the Whole ſhould not be bigger than its Part; than 'tis impoſſible I ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, unleſs I think, and that I ſhould think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am? If I could bring my Mind to doubt once of the two firſt Propoſitions, ſhould I be much pain'd to make queſtion of the third? Or if a <hi>Sceptick</hi> ſhould be ſo impudent to deny me thoſe, need he be more, to deny me this? And ſhould not I find my ſelf equally impower'd to demonſtrate to him all the three? <hi>Deſcartes</hi> in that procedure pretends to ſilence a <hi>Sceptick</hi> that challenges him to demonſtrate any thing; or to ſhew him the evidence of a Propoſition, himſelf pretends to have made him doubt of. The <hi>Sophiſt,</hi> reſolv'd to deny the evidence of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46662:48"/>Propoſition, baffles him: And ſo will I; telling him, I ſtay in the maze of Doubt into which he led me, and am like do to ſo, ſince the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he brings to expedite me thence, is as blind and dark as thoſe which he made me boggle at before.</p>
            <p>But probably <hi>(in purſuance of his humour)</hi> you are charm'd with the wonderful progreſs he makes in his following <hi>Method.</hi> Reflecting, <hi>ſays my Great Philoſopher,</hi> upon that firſt Conlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>I think, therefore I am.</hi> I obſerve I am no other way aſſur'd of the certainty of it, than by having a clear and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of what I there affirm: So that I can take it for a general Rule, that whatever I can clearly and diſtinctly conceive, is true. But is this the peculiar of that favourite Propoſition, only <hi>I think therefore I am?</hi> Suppoſing that <hi>Deſoartes</hi> had left me in the capacity I was, and where I muſt be ſtill, in ſpight of Fate, as to the certainty of theſe Propoſitions Two and Three are five, the Whole is bigger than its Part; might not I make the ſame reflection on theſe Propoſitions as he makes on his? And being not oblig'd to invent a Rule of Truth for the <hi>Gentlemen Scepticks,</hi> but only for my ſelf, which I might make uſe of in forming all my Judgments, might not I be allow'd to argue upon my Propoſitions as he does on his? The reaſon why I am aſcertain'd of theſe Propoſitions, that is; why I not only doubt not of them; but perceive, I cannot doubt of them, if I would, is, that I have a clear and diſtinct perception of what I there affirm: And ſeeing I have ſuch an one, can I ſtill doubt whether I have or not? When to have and to judge I have, or rather to be ſenſible I have it, is the ſelf
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46662:48"/>ſame act of the Underſtanding. For in effect, from thence it is; from my own Conſcience it is proceeds the impoſſibility of doubting of that Propoſition, two and three are five, as well as of that other, <hi>I think therefore, I am,</hi> as all will agree that we are able to judge any whit nicely in ſuch Caſes. I might then equally from theſe and a thouſand other Propoſitions draw the ſame Inference, <hi>Deſcartes</hi> concludes from his, to make a Rule of Truth on, <hi>What I clearly and distinctly conceive is true.</hi> And it is as trifling as abſurd, to make the Certainty and Evidence of ſuch ſort of Propoſitions, depend on the Certainty and Evidence of any other, ſince they are thus certain and evident of themſelves, not from any thing prejudicate or antecedent to them. All of them ſtand on the ſame Square as to their Conviction, and nothing's more unreaſonable or againſt the Rules of Method, than to go to prove them by one another: Hence it is they are called Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Propoſitions; and even <hi>Deſcartes</hi> himſelf will own, That that General Principle, <hi>What I can distinctly conceive is true,</hi> is no ways a Rule of Truth for ſuch kind of Propoſitions; but that their Rule of Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which convinces me of their Truth, is, as I have been ſaying, the only Experience, and internal Senſe alone my Mind has of that Truth, at the inſtant of forming thoſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom the very Name of <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> had put in Humor, ſtaid not long in ſo pleaſant a Road, but purſued to puſh his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms home. The greateſt Pleaſure <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I had in reading that admirable Piece, was to ſee a Man ſo foil, and perplex himſelf, as to lie open, not only to the moſt ſubtle <hi>Sceptick,</hi> but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46662:49"/>to the meaneſt <hi>Logician,</hi> that with three Grains of Wit and Senſe, knew how to inforce the Rules of Logick he has learn'd: With that he run through his <hi>Method,</hi> his <hi>Meditations,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Part of his Book of Principles,</hi> ſo as to let us know, he had attentively examined them. He ſhewed us, in preſenting the Order and Array of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Propoſitions, that no Man ever went ſo prepoſterouſly to work as he, for the Invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Eſtabliſhing a Rule of Truth: For that after having made us doubt of all Things, and next, in this dark Paſſage introduced one Spark of Light, <hi>all that we can diſtinctly conceive is true:</hi> He preſently makes us ſuſpect that again by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe drawn from his third Meditation. <q>But many things which before ſeemed evident, are become again uncertain; which has determin'd me hitherto to queſtion, whether Two and Three are Five: Hereupon it came into my Mind, That poſſibly there was a God, that could have made me of ſuch a Compoſition, as I might be impoſed upon in Things that ſeem moſt clear and evident: And as often as that Thought recurs of the Power of God, it is impoſſible for me not to own, but that, if he pleaſed, he might eaſily have framed me ſo, as to be miſtaken in the Things I moſt clearly conceive: But otherwiſe, upon my ſteady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding thoſe Things I diſtinctly conceive, I am urged with ſo clear Conviction, as to be unable to forbear exclaiming. Deceive me who can; It is impoſſible, ſo long as I think, I ſhould not be, or that I ſhould not have been, ſince it is true at preſent that I am; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be equally impoſſible that Two and Three ſhould not make Five, and ſo of other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46662:49"/>Things, wherein I ſee a palpable Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And indeed having no inducement to believe there is a God, a Deceiver, and not knowing as yet whether there be any at all, the Reaſon that makes me doubtful, being grounded but on that Suſpicion, is but weak, and, as I may ſo ſay, <hi>Metaphyſical.</hi> But to take away this Doubt it ſelf, it is neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether there is a God? And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there be, Whether he can be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> began to deſcant, That <hi>Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> had no longer Right to put off that <hi>Axiom</hi> for a Rule of Truth, <hi>All that we diſtinctly conceive is True:</hi> Seeing he had rendred it ſuſpicious by that Reaſon, drawn from the Power of God; a Reaſon that appeared to him ſo forcible, that it was impoſſible, whilſt he reflected on it, not to own, that God, had he pleaſed, could moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have made us ſo, as to be miſtaken in things we moſt diſtinctly conceive. This ſuppoſed, the Streſs he laid upon the Evidence of his other Propoſitions, could at beſt but ballance it, and render his <hi>Rule of Truth</hi> a <hi>Probability:</hi> Nay it could not do ſo much, ſince it was not to be done, but upon the Strength of the Evidence of the Propoſitions; a Rule that became a moſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and fallible, by that ſole Argument, which he found impoſſible to reſiſt, when he reflected on it: And that the Argument that made him ſuſpect his <hi>Axioms,</hi> though founded on the bare Suppoſal of the Exiſtence of a God, which as yet he had not examin'd, ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as ſo weak and trivial, in reference to a Man, that in purſuit of his <hi>Method</hi> acknowledges the Power of God, in caſe he does exiſt, extends
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46662:50"/>to every thing, and poſſibly to the making us ſuch ſort of Creatures as might be deluded in things they moſt diſtinctly conceive. And that, laſtly, it thwarted all the Rules of Method, for a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that was yet in Doubt of the Truth of that Propoſition; <hi>All that I diſtinctly can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is true:</hi> To dream of proving the Exiſtence of a God, to clear him of that Doubt: For how would he be convinc'd of the Exiſtence of a God, but by ſome evident Demonſtration? And how ſhall he be convinced by ſome evident Demonſtration, ſo long as he ſhall doubt, if what a Man diſtinctly conceives is true?</p>
            <p>From whence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concluded, <hi>Carteſius</hi> made a Circle in his Method; which is the moſt vile and unpardonable Fault that reaſoning can be guilty of: For, according to him, he could no ways be perfectly ſure of that Principle, <hi>All I distinctly conceive is true:</hi> But becauſe there is a God, and becauſe that God is no Deceiver; nor could he know there was a God, and that that God was no Deceiver, but becauſe he knew diſtinctly the Exiſtence of a God, by the Idea he found in himſelf, and becauſe he diſtinctly conceived, That to Deceive was a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God. In a Word, that he proved the Firſt Propoſition by the Second, and the Second by the Firſt, without having the Right to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Truth of either. But Gentlemen <hi>(con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, in an inſulting way)</hi> upon your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I pardon your <hi>Worthy Master</hi> that his unhappy Stumble: It was only a falſe Step he chanced to make in the Dark, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he recovered himſelf, and ſtood upon his Legs. He concluded, For the Exiſtence of a God, and many Truths that we undoubtedly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46662:50"/>and clearly know; the Concluſion is true though the Inference be falſe. But you muſt not take it ill if I add one Word more, a diſgracing his <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Axioms</hi> one by one,<note place="margin">In reſp. ad object. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> make you ſenſible how ill founded is the Reputation of a Philoſopher, ſaid to Argue concluſively and cloſely. I remember I have read in that <hi>Author</hi> a Propoſition pleaſant enough; <hi>viz.</hi> That God could change the Eſſences of things; That the Propoſitions we call neceſſary are only True, becauſe God will have them ſo: And if God had willed it, as he might have willed it, if he pleas'd, that Two and Three ſhould not make Five, that Propoſition, Two and Three are Five at this Day would be falſe. When <hi>Deſcartes</hi> advances that <hi>Paradox,</hi> he would fain be believed to own a vaſt Reſpect for, and moſt humble Submiſſion to the Omnipotency of God, and is angry with the other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and impleads them of almoſt Blaſphemy, for preſuming to ſay, God was not able to cauſe, that Two and Three ſhould not make Five: Yet if you track <hi>Deſcartes</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, you'll quickly find, That 'tis not altogether for his Devotion-ſake he maintains that <hi>Theſis,</hi> but becauſe that abſurd Tenet was the evident Reſult of ſome other Points of his Doctrin: To have admitted of a Propoſition ſo harſh as that, upon Conſtraint, and as a Concluſion drawn naturally from a Principle of his laying, would not have made much for his Honour, and would beſides have diſcouraged others: That made him think it his beſt way to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with them, to make the Out-cry firſt, and to wonder how the Philoſophers could be ſo raſh and inconſiderate as to preſcribe Boundaries to the Almightineſs of God. I ſhall not at preſent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46662:51"/>meddle with the Abſurdity of that Propoſition; I deſign not to correct all the Blunders of that Knight Errant of a Philoſopher; it will be too Glorious for him to underſtand I have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to criticiſe upon him. But to enlarge a little on the Buſineſs in Hand, I ſay, Should all I have urged againſt his Method be falſe; ſhould all the Arguments wherewith the World has baited him, be Void and Null, that <hi>Paradox</hi> alone would totally overthrow him; and let him ſuppoſe it true, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould give us any Rule of Truth: For if it hold, That the Truth of Propoſitions ſo depends on God, as that he could have cauſed thoſe eſteem'd neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily true, to have been falſe, it was in his Power to have made theſe two be falſe; <hi>What I conceive distinctly is true: To deceive is an Imperfection.</hi> If God was able to have done it, how knows <hi>Deſcartes</hi> but he actually has? What greater Reaſon has he to believe he hath not, rather than the contrary? Hath God revealed it to him? Upon his Principle, I'll doubt, not only as a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> but now I'll doubt in earneſt; Thus his two Rules of Truth are no longer Rules of Truth. What now betides his Glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>I think therefore I am?</hi> I have no need to be a <hi>Sceptick</hi> to diſcredit it: Why? Becauſe I know not whether God from all Eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it true or falſe. Nor could I purchaſe that knowledge without a Revelation; and ſtill it muſt be queſtioned whether Revelation could ſerve for a Rule of Truth, in theſe our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Thus <hi>Deſcartes Wiſeman,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made ſo far a Progreſs as to know, he <hi>thought,</hi> and that he <hi>was,</hi> is here unfortunately <hi>non-plus'd.</hi> I have a world of Reflections more to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46662:51"/>make, and I ſhould never be exhauſted if I would enter upon his egregious Metaphyſicks, his new Demonſtrations he pretends to give for the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a God, the Diſtinction of the Soul and Body: Upon his way of anſwering Objections made againſt the reſt of his Method, if I would trouble my ſelf to let you ſee how (when his Propoſitions are attacked, and at once the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of them, or the Method he takes to come to the knowledg of Truth) he contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſometimes to defend his Propoſitions well or ill, without endeavouring to juſtifie his Method, though that is the Piece in which he has pretended moſt to ſhew his Excellency; and which is the moſt deſpicable of all at Bottom, as I think I have ſufficiently proved to you: But this is enough to ſatisfie you, I have not paſs'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on your Maſter without ſufficient Knowledg of the Cauſe: And ſince I have delayed you too long, <hi>Gentlemen Carteſians,</hi> I am your moſt humble Servant; recommend me to your <hi>Illuſtrious Doctor.</hi>

               <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> followed him, taking Leave more civilly, and more like <hi>Gentlemen</hi> than he: And <hi>Plato</hi> added, he was tranſported to ſee <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s Reputation ſo run down in the World; and that he deſerv'd it were it for nothing, but his Behaviour towards the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and eſpecially for his ill-natur'd Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age unto <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf: That he had uſed all Endeavours poſſible to ſuppreſs the Reputation with which they flouriſhed in the World, and had uſed leſs reſerve toward him than all the reſt, although he had been his <hi>Master;</hi> and meerly by his Calumnies in Point of Doctrin, he had raiſed himſelf to the Character of <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>

            <p>You know not, ſaid I, what Time may ſtill bring forth, and you need not deſpair of coming in Play again. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy has had many Turns of Fortune within this Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years; and I'll tell you, as a Piece of News from our World, That hardly more than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years ago, the <hi>Sovereign Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church</hi> was upon putting forth a <hi>Placate,</hi> commanding your <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſhould be taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s, and he had gained the Point, but for a great Man of that Time, called <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> If that had once paſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> there had been a Fatal Stroke to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, and <hi>yours</hi> had carried it all the World over. You at once ſurprize and pleaſe me, (<hi>replyed</hi> Plato) I am extreamly Glad, and moſt highly obliged to you for this News: <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſhall know it, and I'll imploy it to revenge the Inſult of his late Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Mean while my two Guides were enraged to hear their <hi>Maſter</hi> treated in ſo vile a manner; they had waited the End of his Diſcourſe, to anſwer it, but obſerving him troop off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them the Opportunity, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, what they could to ſtop him: As they ſaw it was in vain, the <hi>old Gentleman</hi> raillying, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him at a Diſtance, So ho, <hi>Good Monſieur Aristotle,</hi> where may a Man find your <hi>Sphere of Fire?</hi> we have not met with it in our Voyage; though your Books give us Intelligence it was placed above the <hi>Air,</hi> and yet below the <hi>Moon.</hi> For my part I was highly gratify'd with that Encounter, and Diſcourſe; I had the Pleaſure to obſerve, That <hi>Spiritual Philoſophers</hi> no more than <hi>Corporal</hi> could forbear diſputing, and were no leſs jealous of their Sentiments and Reputation.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46662:52"/>I had the Happineſs of this Diverſion more than once in my <hi>Voyage,</hi> upon ſeveral Occaſions; of which I ſhall give account.</p>
            <p>After the Departure of our <hi>three Philoſophers;</hi> well, (<hi>ſaid I to</hi> Father Merſennus) what think you, <hi>Father,</hi> now of <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> Indeed he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me a litte hot; but after all, methinks he's no ill Diſputant: That way of tracing <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſtep by ſtep in his <hi>Method</hi> of the re-ſearch of Truth, is very maliciouſly deſign'd, and capable of raiſing Scruples, eſpecially that laſt Argument taken from the Truth of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Propoſitions, that with <hi>Deſcartes</hi> have their Dependance upon God, ſeemed perplexing enough: And I do not remember that any one has before hit upon the Uſe that he hath made on't.</p>
            <p>Stuff! meer Stuff! <hi>(he replyed)</hi> All that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> has ſaid, ſcarce any thing was tolerable but the Circle he charged upon <hi>Deſcartes;</hi> and that's an antiquated Objection; I my ſelf have touched upon it heretofore, as you may ſee in the <hi>Second Objections,</hi> that come after his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,</hi> which are my own as well as the <hi>Sixth.</hi> I am glad I know ſo much, <hi>(I returned)</hi> they be both moſt worthy of you, and admirably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and I am very well ſatisfied, That Circle is ſomething more than imaginary; for 'tis not to be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Father Merſennus, Ariſtotle, M. Arnauld,</hi> who is the Author of the <hi>Fourth Set</hi> of <hi>Objections,</hi> and ſeveral others, had all met in the ſelf-ſame Point, but that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it very like at leaſt, what they there apprehended. But under the Roſe, do you take that anſwer <hi>M. Decſartes</hi> gives to get out of that unlucky Circle, and that no one ever yet has
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46662:53"/>took in hand to be ſatisfactory or fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? He anſwers, That in ſaying, We knew nothing certainly, before our Conviction of the Exiſtence of a God, he had expreſsly noted, That he only meant it of ſome Concluſions that might come into our Mind, at the ſame Time we reflected not on the Principles, from which they were derived.</p>
            <p>It would perhaps be ſomewhat difficult to make that Propoſition capable of any tolerable Senſe; but 'tis the eaſieſt thing of an hundred to ſhew it to be a meer Fetch and Evaſion; and to diſprove the Truth of the thing itſelf, it is but reading the ſame Place <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> now cited, of his <hi>Third Meditation, Page the thirty fifth and thirty ſixth of his Method, Number the fifth of the firſt Part of his Principles;</hi> and one ſhall ſee he there makes us doubt of all, even of Principles that carry with them their own Evidence; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that Principle itſelf, <hi>What I diſtinctly conceive is true,</hi> by the Suſpicion we have there is a God, who could ſo have conſtituted us, as we might be miſtaken in things moſt clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: So that when he ſays, We know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſurely, before the Knowledg of a God, he ſpeaks not only of ſome certain Concluſions that ſtrike upon our Mind, ſeparately from their Principles, but of all ſorts of Knowledg, and of that it ſelf, <hi>What we diſtinctly conceive is true.</hi> And hereupon it is your ſelf, <hi>Ariſtotle, M. Arnauld</hi> and others, have trapt him in a Circle.</p>
            <p>I own, That Anſwer may be found in ſome of his Letters, occaſioned by the ſame Objection ſtarted to him afreſh. I know that he repeats it not by way of Anſwer, but couching it cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46662:53"/>in the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> where he gives us an Abſtract of his <hi>Method,</hi> and his <hi>Meditations;</hi> but that's no <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Buſineſs. Beſides, thoſe Words have a very ill Effect, in the <hi>Firſt Part of his Principles,</hi> for they unhappily ſtand ſo near the other, that make us doubt of ſelf-evident Propoſitions, becauſe of the Suſpicion we have of a God, that, may be, employs his Power to deceive us; that the Contradiction plainly ſtrikes our Eyes.</p>
            <p>Nor has his famous Propoſition, <hi>I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am,</hi> any better Succeſs; for having given us that Propoſition as the firſt of which we could be aſſured, we might demonſtrate to him, That cannot be the firſt, ſince its certainty neceſſarily ſuppoſes the Truth of ſome others, and in thoſe of theſe: <hi>It is impoſſible that that which thinks ſhould not be; it is a Contradiction for any thing to think, and yet not be in the inſtant that it thinks.</hi> The Propoſition (which is very remarkable) by which he proves that other, <hi>I think therefore I am,</hi> at the ſame Time he pretends it to be the firſt of all. He declares then, That when he ſays, that Propoſition, <hi>I think therefore I am,</hi> is the firſt and moſt certain of all thoſe which offer themſelves to the Mind of a Man, who obſerves Method in Philoſophy; he pretends not to deny but that he muſt be certain of this before; <hi>It is impoſſible that he that thinks ſhould not be;</hi> as alſo of divers others. Joyn this Acknowledgment with what he ſays in the <hi>foregoing Page,</hi> 
               <q>We muſt likewiſe doubt of other Things, which we held moſt certain, of <hi>Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi> even of Principles that we thought ſelf-evident until now:</q> What are then ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Propoſitions if not theſe? It is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46662:54"/>That a thing ſhould be and not be: A thing cannot be, and not be at the ſame Time, cannot act, and not be, and the like. He then ſuppoſes not the Truth of theſe Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doubts of them. And in Truth, the Reaſon he brings to make us doubt of ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propoſitions extends equally to all. We muſt doubt, ſays he, of Principles that we call ſelf-evident, becauſe we have heard there is a God, who can do all Things; and who knows, but he may have ſo contrived us, as we might always be deceived, even in things that ſeem moſt evident? And be pleaſed to recollect, <hi>my Father,</hi> what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid in Concluding; That <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Propoſitions were leſs to be found Fault with than their Connexion and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal in his Method that he takes to come to Truth; and that the Truth of ſome certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions was not abſolutely conteſted, but only with reference to the Method that he takes, by which he forfeits the Priviledg to ſuppoſe them, be they as true as may be, ſince according to that Method he is diſabled from acquiring the Knowledg of their Truth. And it is upon that account, probably, he was put ſo out of Humor with <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and <hi>Father Bourdin</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> who were thoſe that chiefly cloſed with him in that Lock. Their Scruples are propoſed in a lively manner in <hi>Latin;</hi> and it were well if the <hi>French Tranſlation</hi> equalled the <hi>Original.</hi> But upon the mentioning the <hi>French Tranſlation,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to add one little Remark, I made a few Days ſince, and thought not fit to communicate to others. <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s dear Diſciples being poſſibly put to it (at leaſt I ſo imagine) to diſengage their Maſter of thoſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46662:54"/>petty Perplexities, of which I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in the <hi>French Verſion,</hi> that has been put forth, of his Works, and which had his own Approbation, have ſomewhat ſweetned that diſtaſtful Propoſition, in the firſt Part of his Principles. The <hi>Latin</hi> has it thus, <hi>Dubitabimus etiam de reliquis, quae antea pro maxime certis habui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: Etiam de Mathematicis demonstrationibus, etiam de iis principiis quae hactenus putavimus eſſe per ſe nota.</hi> It would be natural to render it: We will doubt of other things, which before we held moſt certain; alſo of Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; alſo of thoſe Principles which hitherto we thought ſelf-evident: They have turned it ſo, I ſay, in <hi>French,</hi> as to make us believe, That <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſpoke not of ſelf-evident Principles in general, but only of Mathematical: <hi>Nous dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terons auſſi de toutes les autres choſes qui nous ont ſemble autrefois tres certains: Meme des demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions de Mathematique, &amp; de ſes principes, encore que d'eux-memes ils ſoient aſſez manifeſtes.</hi> We will doubt alſo of all thoſe things we hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſteemed moſt certain, even of the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Mathematicks and their Principles, though they are ſufficiently manifeſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If this was deſignedly done, as one may reaſonably ſuppoſe, it was a little Innocent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain, that obliged <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and injured no Man; and prevented at leaſt the Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhould be viſible. But to return to the Anſwer <hi>Deſcartes</hi> made to the Circle alledged, What think you <hi>Father,</hi> is't a good Defence? Or is it not to make a Retreat and Capitulate with his Enemies? Or rather, to ſpeak more plainly and truly, to unſay and contradict? In good Faith, Father, declare it ingenuouſly; you have treated
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46662:55"/>
               <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> ſomewhat like a Friend, or rather as a generous Enemy, you have diſarmed him: He was a Man that ſcorned to beg his Life; you foreſaw too how high he'd carry it after the Combate, and ſtill would challenge all he met with; yet for all that, you have thought fit to give him Quarter, as a Man that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in Conſideration of thoſe other great Services he has done Philoſophy: I applaud your Generoſity, and you have no reaſon to repent on't.</p>
            <p>That little Softning, with which I temper'd the Harſhneſs of my Criticks, had its deſign'd Effect, which was not wholly to ſowre <hi>Father Merſennus.</hi> He took it graciouſly enough, and only anſwered in a rallying way, You are a very Wrangler, and delight to find a Quarrel; and the Humor that I ſee you are of, had you lived in <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Time, you had certainly incurred his ſpending a whole Chapter on you. But all that you ſay comes to juſt nothing, as I could eaſily convince you; but the Diſcuſſion of Fact, and Contradiction is too tedious an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us Travellers. I perceive too <hi>Monſieur</hi> is tired already with it, continued he, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> and only wants a Mouth to yawn. Come, ſays he, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> you ſeem ſomething Melancholy, brighten a little, brighten; What do you think of?</p>
            <p>Think? of nothing ſaid he. How <hi>Monſieur, (I replyed)</hi> What's that you ſpoke? certainly Blaſphemy againſt the Doctrin of our Maſter: If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had heard you, what would he have ſaid? Do you <hi>think</hi> of nothing? So, What's become of the Eſſence of the Soul, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is <hi>thinking?</hi> I had as lieve you'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46662:55"/>tell me that you have no <hi>Being</hi> as that you do not <hi>think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He took me up in a very ſerious Air, which ſufficiently beſpoke a greater Diſpleaſure my Words had given him, than <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> before. You put a perverſe Conſtruction on my Propoſition, which meant no more, than that my Mind was not poſſeſſed with Melancholy <hi>Ideas,</hi> as you thought: I am heartily glad, <hi>Monſieur, ſaid I,</hi> for Gayety and Briskneſs are never more neceſſary than in a <hi>Journey:</hi> But ſince we are fallen bechance upon the Eſſence of the Soul, I could wiſh you'd plainly expound what <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> has ſaid thereon; for as pure a Spirit as I am, I have no clear inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my own Eſſence; and I wonder at it. A very ill Sign, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that's as much as to ſay, your Intellect is benighted ſtill with Prejudice, and which I have already too much perceiv'd in you: And I well obſerve, that Novice which we lately met has raiſed freſh Scruples in you by his <hi>Sophistry. Monſieur,</hi> I replyed, to uſe no Diſguiſe with you, I'll frankly lay open the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of my Soul, in which I find it. I am raviſh'd in my Thoughts to meet with thoſe that contradict <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> that opens and enlarges my Mind: But how ſtrong ſoever their Arguments appear, I ſecure my ſelf againſt them, and ſtill reſerve my Mind docil and tractable for the Inſtructions of that great <hi>Genius,</hi> ſuppoſing he has the Leiſure or the Goodneſs to beſtow ſome on me, when I ſhall have the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ſee him. As for the Preconceptions of the Schools and Childhood, I have for the moſt part quit them, as I paſſed my Word before I undreſſed me of my Body: Yet I confeſs ſome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46662:56"/>ſtill remain, concerning the Eſſence of the Body, and the Eſſence of the Soul, which I hardly can call by that Name, in the ſignification you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, ſince they ſeem grounded upon Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and on ſolid Reaſon. I have however too great a Deference for <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> to be throughly confirm'd that they are not falſe; ſo that I am willing to acknowledg, to ſpeak in finer Language, a gloomy kind of Darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts my Mind in thoſe Particulars; and I have not yet obtain'd the Priviledg of <hi>Carteſian Souls,</hi> to have moſt diſtinct <hi>Ideas</hi> of thoſe two kinds of <hi>Being,</hi> which make up the World. But once more I ſhall ſubmit to your Inſtructions and <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>He then began to explain the Doctrin of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius</hi> thereupon, but ſaid no more than I before had read in his <hi>Meditations,</hi> in his <hi>Method,</hi> in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> and in ſome of his <hi>Letters.</hi> I ſhall not here give any Expoſition of that Doctrin, becauſe I ſhall have an occaſion to ſpeak of it upon an Adventure that befel us in the Globe of the Moon. I pretended out of Complaiſance to have a better Taſte of it than before, and to find more Solidity in it than when I read it by my ſelf. That acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſtated my Companions in their jocular Humour, who after much Merriment and Droll, upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, wheel'd about unto his <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> which according to his Map of the World ought to be ſituated under the <hi>Moon,</hi> of which yet we ſaw not the leaſt ſign or footſtep in our <hi>Voyage.</hi> They were very Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and Witty thereupon, and reminded me of a Suit commenc'd ſome years ago, by the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi> againſt the <hi>new Philoſophers,</hi> for diſturbing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46662:56"/>them in the poſſeſſion of that <hi>Sphere,</hi> warranted by the Preſcription of ſo many Ages; and of a Decree made in favour of the <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to a falſly ſuppos'd Survey they had taken of the place. 'Twas ordered that the Sphere of Fire ſhould ſtill remain where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had pitch'd it. Now as that Decree, ſay they, was a Decree upon <hi>Requeſt</hi> and not <hi>Contradictory,</hi> the new Philoſophers may revive the Action, and bring the Proceſs to a ſecond Hearing: And in that Caſe you are able to give evidence of the Truth, and convict the Peripateticks of the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of their Titles, in a Concern of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>You may ſay what you pleaſe, ſaid I, tho' that <hi>Sphere</hi> is not now to be found; If I was to judg in that Action, I ſhould not ſo readily condemn <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> It may have been diſpers'd, and ſpent in the ſpace of almoſt two thouſand years: For that many Stars that have formerly appear'd in the Heavens now diſappear: What's become of the ſeventh <hi>Pleiade,</hi> and of that ſeen the laſt Age in the <hi>Conſtellation</hi> of <hi>Caſſiope?</hi> And ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any one, ſince its ceaſing to appear, ſhould bring his Action againſt <hi>Tyco Bruhe</hi> and others that obſerv'd it, as falſe Intelligencers, that thus'd the credulous World, do you think it would not be thrown out? And does not <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> himſelf give us to apprehend that our <hi>Vortex,</hi> infinitely greater than the <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> ſhall be ſometime ſwallow'd up, when one leaſt thinks on't? And when by that Abſorption the Sun ſhall become an Earth, and perhaps at once the ſubtil Matter which is confin'd in the Centre of our Earth, forcing its Paſſage through the Cruſts that cover it, ſhall make that a Sun;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46662:57"/>granting that the Books of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> exiſted in another <hi>Vortex</hi> where are Men, would not they look on all he has wrote of our World as Fabulous and <hi>Romantick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, granting that there never was a <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> it was ever admirably ſuppos'd. Never was <hi>System</hi> more exactly contriv'd than <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s of the Elements. They all are rang'd according to the Dignity or Meanneſs of their Nature. The <hi>Earth</hi> as the moſt unactive and ignoble Element, has the loweſt Seat. The <hi>Water,</hi> leſs courſe and heavy than the Earth, takes place above it. The <hi>Air,</hi> by reaſon of its Subtilty, is exalted higher than the Water. And the <hi>Fire</hi> the moſt noble and moſt vigorous of them all, owns no Superior but the Stars, and the ſubtil Matter in which ſwim the Planets. The extent of each is likewiſe proportion'd to the Merit of their Nature: Like Brethren they have divided the Eſtate of the four Qualities, each of them has two, one of which in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Degree. The <hi>Earth</hi> is cold and dry, the <hi>Water</hi> is cold and moiſt, the <hi>Air</hi> is hot and moiſt, the <hi>Fire</hi> is hot and dry. And to the end they may bear up ſtill, in the perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats they give each other; if the prevaling Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of one's more active, the predominant Quality of the others put them in a good poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of Defence againſt the effort of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Could any thing be more juſtly or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly imagin'd? In fine, with how many fine Thoughts has that <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Diſpoſition of the Elements, furniſhed our Preachers heretofore, and ſtill ſupplies thoſe of <hi>Italy?</hi> But to mention ſomething better in its kind, that one <hi>Deviſe</hi> of <hi>Father le Moine,</hi> of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46662:57"/>which the <hi>Sphere of Fire</hi> is the Subſtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves there had been one, and would deſerve there ſhould be one ſtill, and that it ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever. Deſigning to ſignifie the more <hi>pure</hi> are Friendſhips, the more <hi>durable</hi> they are, he painted the <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> with this <hi>Spaniſh Motto, Eterno porque Puro.</hi> This Fire's Eternal, becauſe it's pure. What an unhappineſs it is that that Thought ſo fine and ſolid as it is all over, ſhould at laſt be falſe for want of a <hi>Sphere of Fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I was defending as well as I could, the <hi>Peripatetick Intereſt,</hi> whilſt we arriv'd at the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> I ſhall not be tedious in giving a large Deſcription of it, ſince others have don't before me. I will only ſay that the <hi>Earth,</hi> look't to us that view'd it from the <hi>Moon,</hi> as the Moon appears to thoſe that view it from the <hi>Earth,</hi> with this difference, that the <hi>Earth</hi> ſeem'd big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger far, becauſe it really is ſo. So we judg'd that the Earth, in reſpect of thoſe that beheld it from the <hi>Moon,</hi> had the ſame <hi>Phaſes</hi> as the <hi>Moon,</hi> in regard of thoſe that behold it from the <hi>Earth;</hi> that it had its <hi>Quadratures,</hi> its <hi>Oppoſitions,</hi> its <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> except that it could never be totally Eclips'd, by the reaſon of its greatneſs in compariſon of the <hi>Moon,</hi> whoſe Shade could not have a Diameter ſo large as the Earth then in Conjunction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> is a Maſs of Matter much like that of which the <hi>Earth</hi> is compos'd. There you have Fields and Foreſts, Seas and Rivers. I ſaw no Animals indeed, but I am of Opinion if there were ſome tranſported they would thrive, and probably multiply.<note place="margin">Empire de la Lune.</note> 'Tis falſe that there are Men there, as <hi>Cyrano</hi> reports; but 'twas
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46662:58"/>undeſignedly that he deceiv'd us, having firſt been deceiv'd himſelf. One of the ſeparate Souls which we found in great Multitudes, and which were there at his Arrival, told me the Original of that Error. A great Company of Souls ſurpriz'd to ſee a Man with his Body, in a Land where the like was never ſeen before, had a mind to know the meaning of it. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed together to appear in Human Shape to him: They accoſt him, and enquire by what Method he accompliſh'd ſo great a <hi>Voyage:</hi> Made him relate what he knew of <hi>our World;</hi> and as he ſeem'd equally inquiſitive as to the Tranſactions of the <hi>World</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Life the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants led there, the <hi>Familiar Spirit of</hi> Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, who was among the reſt, took upon him to anſwer: And having declar'd who he was, as that <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> himſelf relates, he made him upon the Spot, a Fantaſtical Syſtem of the Republick and Society, which is the ſame he gives us in his Relation, where he ſeriouſly tells us, There are Men in the <hi>Moon;</hi> characters their Humour, deſcribes their Employments, their Cuſtoms and Government. But 'tis worth the knowing that ſome Fopperies he has inſerted, he brought not from that Country, as the Soul aſſur'd me; and that many Profane Alluſions and Libertine Reflections he there makes, were only the Fruits of a debauch'd Imagination and a corrupt Mind, ſuch as was that <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> or of the Imitation of an <hi>Author,</hi> yet more Atheiſtical than himſelf. I mean <hi>Lucian,</hi> one of whoſe Works was made the Plan to his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inequalities we found in the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> are partly Iſles, wherewith the Seas there are pleaſantly chequer'd, and partly Hills and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46662:58"/>Vallies in its Continent. They belong to ſeveral famous <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> whoſe Names they bear, and who are the high and mighty States there. We landed in <hi>Gaſſendi,</hi> a Seat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fine and very appoſite, and ſuch in a Word as an <hi>Abbot,</hi> like <hi>Monſieur Gaſſendus,</hi> could make it, who wanted for neither Genius, Art nor Science, and who had no uſe for his Revenues, in gaming treating and living high. The Lord of the Mannor was then abſent, whom we ſhould have been glad to have waited on, ſince we heard that he ſtill continu'd his Civility and Moderation, which were his Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. And though formerly there were ſome Miſunderſtandings betwixt him and <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> yet he always very obligingly, and with a Mark of Diſtinction, entertain'd the <hi>Carteſians</hi> that came to pay a Viſit, and eſpecially <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> who was his peculiar Friend. He was a Man that equall'd <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Genius,</hi> excell'd him in the reach and extent of Science, but was leſs heady and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited. He ſeem'd ſomewhat a <hi>Pyrrhoniſt</hi> in Natural Philoſophy, which in my Opinion is becoming enough of a Philoſopher, who provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he looks into himſelf, muſt know by his own Experience the Limits of a Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the ſhort Sightedneſs of its Views.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Gaſſendi, Father Merſennus</hi> conducted us to the <hi>Land</hi> that bears his Name. It is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſituate upon the ſame Coaſt, as <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> bordering upon the <hi>round</hi> Sea, which others call the <hi>Sea of Humours,</hi> which is a great <hi>Gulph</hi> of the <hi>Lunary Ocean,</hi> bounded on one ſide by the Continent, on which lies <hi>Merſennus,</hi> and on
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46662:59"/>the other by an <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> at the end whereof, Northwards, is a <hi>Peninſule</hi> call'd <hi>Dream-land. Merſennus</hi> is only commendable for its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proſpect, being a very hosky and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country by the reaſon of the abundant Heat there, from which it has taken a Name, and is call'd <hi>Hotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſtaid in this place about half a quarter of an hour, when I intimated to <hi>F. Merſennus,</hi> that before we proſecuted our <hi>Journy,</hi> I ſhould be glad to traverſe the <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> wherein we were. That <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces our <hi>Earth,</hi> and 'tis falſe that the Moon turns upon its Centre, as ſome imagine: It only has a Motion of Vibration, which weighs it from Eaſt to Weſt, and from Weſt to Eaſt, which Motion <hi>Galilaeſus</hi> firſt perceiv'd, having obſerv'd by a Tube, that the place we call <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> is ſometimes nearer and ſometimes farther off the Oriental. Zone of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> oppoſite to it, is ſometimes nearer and ſometimes farther off the Occidental Zone. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merſennus,</hi> willingly conſented to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, for as much as he himſelf had never made that <hi>Voyage.</hi> We croſs'd the <hi>great Ocean,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the left Hand the <hi>Iſle of Winds,</hi> and on the right, that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and paſs'd over that of <hi>Pitheas,</hi> ſtill puſhing on quite to the <hi>Sea of Rains,</hi> which is bounded by a vaſt <hi>Land</hi> ſtretch'd from Eaſt to Weſt, much like that of <hi>America,</hi> as it is decypher'd in the Maps; whoſe Eaſtern part is call'd <hi>Fog-land,</hi> and the Weſtern <hi>Hait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both ſeem'd like two mighty Deſerts. Towards the middle of that Land, upon the Shore of the <hi>Sea of Rains,</hi> we diſcover'd a kind of a large Town, of an oval Figure, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46662:59"/>we had the Curioſity to go to ſee; but we found all the Avenues guarded with Souls who deny'd us Entrance, tho' civilly and obligingly enough. We demanded of one of them, What Town that was, and why there was no Admiſſion? He anſwer'd, it was call'd <hi>Plato,</hi> and was the ſame where that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whoſe Name it bore, had eſtabliſh'd his <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> that no Perſons were admitted there, which he himſelf had not firſt examin'd, which Caution he obſerv'd, for fear ſome Stranger ſhould bring thither the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>other World,</hi> which were the only Peſtilence that <hi>Republick</hi> had to fear; that <hi>Plato</hi> was not at home at preſent, but would return in a little time; and in Caſe we deſir'd to have Admiſſion, we might, waiting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Plato,</hi> commence our Quarantine at <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret,</hi> which was a little Seat upon a riſing Ground, we ſaw ſome diſtance from the Town; that that Quarantine was not a Quarantine of days, but a Quarantine of Years; becauſe the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſeaſes a <hi>Spirit</hi> was tainted with, were purg'd off with far greater Difficulty than the Peſtilential Airs of <hi>Bodies</hi> are diſpers'd, which come from infected Places. We thank'd him for his offers, and told him, We came not there with a Deſign to ſettle, but that we were going farther; that if <hi>Plato</hi> had been in Town, he probably would have had ſome Condeſcenſion towards us; that we had met him in our Journy, and had receiv'd great Civilities from him: And that we muſt endeavour to be contented upon the diſappointment of our Curioſity, on that occaſion. So we bent on our Journy, diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied enough, from the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> where we little thought they had treated Strangers as they do in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46662:60"/>
            <p>From thence we travell'd over all that Land from North to South, after which we diſcover'd another Sea, call'd the <hi>Sea of Cold,</hi> in which ſtood a very fair <hi>Iſland,</hi> which they ſaid was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s; we made no Debate whether we ſhould take it in our Road: The only Queſtion was, Whether if we were ask'd who and what we were, we ſhould declare our ſelves <hi>Carteſians?</hi> It was my Sentiment not to carry it ſo high in an Enemies Country: But Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> and my <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> concluded for the contrary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado adding, there was nothing we need to fear; that if we were beſet we had wherewithal to defend our Selves, and in point of Spiritual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, the Number came not in the Account; that it was not the firſt time, there had been ſeen a <hi>ſingle Carteſian,</hi> that fronted with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs a <hi>Claſs</hi> of four hundred <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd by a <hi>Regent</hi> of conſummate Experience. Only we muſt keep a ſtrict Guard upon our ſelves, to offer no Inſult or Raillery, that might give Offence to thoſe we converſed with.</p>
            <p>But it was a great Surprize to us upon our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, to ſee this Iſland under a ſtricter Guard than that of <hi>Plato.</hi> They were there in Battel Array, as in a Town that had the Enemy at the Gates, and expected the next News ſhould be of being begirt with a cloſe Siege. There was your Court of Guards advanc'd far into the Field, your Centuries upon all the Hills round about, and Scouts and Intelligences in all parts of the Air. As we came within three hundred Paces of the place, we ſaw a Detachment of about a dozen Souls, drawn from the Court of Guard, approach us. He that commanded them

            <p>No ſooner the Advice arriv'd to the Officer, but all his Troops at a Signal given, were arm'd <hi>capape,</hi> and gave us to underſtand by their looks they were in readineſs to receive the Enemy: That is, they were accoutred with <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> in all ſorts of <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> whereof ſome concluded for the <hi>Soul of Beaſts,</hi> others for the neceſſity of <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> in mixt Bodies; others for <hi>Abſolute Accidents,</hi> and ſuch like Things, againſt which <hi>M.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Paris</hi> and formerly my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> in Philoſophy: O God! ſaid he, adreſſing himſelf to me, and muſt I have the Affliction of ſeeing you on the ſide of our Enemies conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending even to the ſervil Office of a Spy? Is this Recompence you make for the Pains I have taken? Have you met with a courſe of Philoſophy, comparable to mine, which was then reputed, the moſt gentile and ſolid in the whole <hi>

What Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had you to take up arms againſt him? <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur (I reply'd)</hi> I ſtill preſerve that Reſpect, that Eſteem and Friendſhip for you, which I owe, inviolable, and I take it for a peculiar favour of Fortune to meet you here, to make a freſh Proteſtation of them. And I aſſure you, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46662:61"/>I am neither come in quality of a Spy or Enemy, but if you pleaſe ſo to receive me, of a <hi>Voyager:</hi> 'Twas purely curioſity that brought me hither, by the way. As to the concern of Philoſophy, I muſt acknowledge I am a little <hi>Sceptical</hi> in that Matter, and know not at preſent what I am. I am reſolv'd to try all Sects before I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd; ſo that you may, Sir, look upon me as a Man of an unintereſted Country, and that contrives no Plot or Miſcheivous Deſign againſt your <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> Theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> indeed, are profeſs'd <hi>Carteſians,</hi> but they are <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and Men of Honour, and have Eſteem for Merit though it be on the contrary ſide; and who hold, that <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in point of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> is the unviolable Charter of all honeſt well bred Men: But <hi>(I purſued)</hi> I am highly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the buſtle and diſturbance in this Country: There's no <hi>Spaniſh' Town</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> ſo readily Alarm'd as yours; What is't you ſo much dread?</p>
            <p>That which we ſo much dread, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable <hi>Enemy</hi> of our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> your <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> who when on <hi>Earth,</hi> did all imaginable towards the extirpating the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and only deſiſted there, as we are from good Hands inform'd, to come to ruin them in <hi>this Country.</hi> It is now more than thirty years, ſo exact a Guard has been obſerv'd, to prevent a Surprize conſequent to the Advice we have had, that in all this time he hath been forming a Party, and gathering all the Forces poſſible, in order to a Deſcent. This is the Intelligence we have receiv'd from a <hi>Dutch Profeſſor</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> who acts here as <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Abſence. But <hi>Deſcartes</hi> may come as ſoon as he pleaſes; you ſee we are in a capacity to receive him.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:46662:61"/>
            <p>Well, <hi>Monſieur (ſaid I)</hi> if that be all, you may ſleep ſecure; <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes,</hi> I aſſure you, has no Deſign of an Invaſion in his Head; he's a thouſand Times farther off this Place than 'tis from hence to <hi>Earth;</hi> he is thinking of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>New World</hi> above the Heavens; he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to ſee the Execution of his Grand Deſign, and thither 'tis we are going: And to convince you of the Truth of what I ſay, 'tis but deput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we part, ſome Souls to bear us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and they ſhall bring you an account of what they there ſhall ſee.</p>
            <p>You rejoyce me mightily, ſaid he, for we Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks are tired with theſe long Fatigues: but take it not ill, that I execute my Orders, and conduct you to the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Place, according to the Cuſtom, That all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of a different Sect from ours, arriving here, give him an account what Project brought them hither; we have uſed this Courſe but ſince <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has given us theſe Alarms. So we took the Road that led to the Place, convoyed with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of about fifty Souls, <hi>Academiques</hi> for the moſt part and <hi>Collegians,</hi> who look'd as if they did not wiſh us very well; that Place was only a great Garden that repreſented the <hi>Lyceum</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> uſed to teach his Scholars walking, whence they derived the Name of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks:</hi> 'Tis of a great extent and very finely kept, it is cut into abundance of Allies, whereof the four greateſt meet in the middle of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, at a round large Fountain, whereon is raiſed a ſtately Pedeſtal of the moſt delicate Marble I ever ſaw, on which ſtands the Statue of <hi>Alxander the Great,</hi> crowned by <hi>Victory</hi> with Lawrels, trampling under Foot Scepters and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46662:62"/>Crowns, and Bucklers and broken Arms, and the Treaſures of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Four great Statues, chained to the four Corners repreſent the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nations <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered. I found that Monument ſo like that of the <hi>Place des Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoires,</hi> that I ſhould have believed one had been the Pattern to the other, had not I at the ſame Time made Reflection, that the near Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of thoſe two Hero's, might eaſily have furniſhed the Minds of both the Undertakers with the ſame Ideas. All the Figures of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, no leſs than the other Statues in ſeveral Parts of the Garden, as thoſe of <hi>Philippus, Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> and many other illuſtrious Perſonages, who formerly honoured <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are of <hi>Silver,</hi> for Silver is very cheap and common in the <hi>Globe of the Moon;</hi> and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably for that Reaſon <hi>Chymists</hi> who always affect Myſtery in their Words, call that <hi>Metal</hi> by the Name of the <hi>Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we were admiring that noble Monument, we were aſtoniſhed to ſee all of a ſudden, four Water-Spouts riſe from the four Angles of the Pedeſtal, the largeſt and the higheſt that ever were; they mounted at leaſt four hundred Poles in heighth, and they were brought from a River behind a neighbouring Mountain that was higher than the Wells of <hi>Domme</hi> in <hi>Auvergn;</hi> over which the Water was carried by the admirable Contrivance of the Old Philoſophy, that in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Horror of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, ſhew'd how with Pumps to fling Water infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely high, which Secret is unfortunately loſt in our World; for ſince the Time of <hi>Galileus</hi> we can raiſe Water no higher than three or four and thirty Foot. We ſaw theſe Water Spouts on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46662:62"/>every Side, the leaſt of which exceeded the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Trees that encompaſſed the Garden. From the middle of the Garden we obſerved four Halls of different Figure and Architecture, one at the End of each of the four Alleys: We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the biggeſt of them, which was of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Beauty and Magnificence, being of Gold, Azure and Precious Stones. On both Sides, in the Intervals of the Windows was your Imboſſed Work of Silver, excellently carved; but that made a Gallimawfry odd and humerous enough; for on one Part on the Right-hand were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the famous Exploits of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of <hi>Darius</hi> near the City <hi>Arbela,</hi> the Attack of <hi>Porus</hi> his Army, the Paſſage of <hi>Granicus,</hi> and the Taking of the City <hi>Tyre.</hi> On the other were <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> over the reſt of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and the Extravagancies of thoſe that went for Wiſemen before his Time.</p>
            <p>The firſt on the Left-hand exhibits <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> doctrining his Diſciples, and preſenting them with a ſort of Table-Book, wherein, among others, were written theſe three <hi>Precepts:</hi> Firſt, That they were to <hi>hear</hi> him full <hi>five Years</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a Word to contradict him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They muſt lend an attentive Ear, eſpecially in the Night, to the Muſick and Harmony of the <hi>Celestial Spheres,</hi> which only Wiſemen are priviledged to underſtand. And, Thirdly, they muſt abſtain from eating <hi>Beans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second ſhews you <hi>Democritus</hi> laughing with Might and Main, and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> weeping in warm Tears, and a Troop of little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hooping after them as after two Fools.</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:46662:63"/>
            <p>In the Third we had <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynique,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited like a Morris-Dancer, mounted upon a Croſs-way-ſtone, at bottom of which lay his <hi>Tub,</hi> expounding to an Auditory much like that of the Singers <hi>du pont neuf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt ſate <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> on an exalted Seat, that looked more like a Throne than a Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Chair, and at his Feet ſtood all the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> that lived before him, in Admiration, and liſtning to him as an <hi>Oracle.</hi> Before the Throne of <hi>Aristotle</hi> were heaped the Books that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Writings of thoſe ſame <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> his <hi>Predeceſsors,</hi> which one was putting Fire to, to ſacrifice them to the <hi>Goddeſs Wiſdom,</hi> whoſe Head reſembled a Sun, brandiſhing abundance of Rays upon the Face of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and making a Glory round about it.</p>
            <p>At the Bottom of the Hall, upon a kind of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſtands a large Silver Statue of the beautiful <hi>Pythias,</hi> formerly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Lady,</hi> for whom his Paſſion was ſo ſtrong, as to Sacriſice unto her.</p>
            <p>At the Top of the Hall was a Ceiling, enrich'd with admirable Paintings, lately done, divided likewiſe betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Emboſſings; for on one Side was the <hi>Hero</hi> receiving a Thunderbolt from the Hand of his pretended Father <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> to fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all the Princes of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and on the other the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> receiving another from the Hand of <hi>Minerva,</hi> to thunderclap all the <hi>Chieftains,</hi> of the New Sects of Philoſophy, among which we eaſily knew <hi>M. Deſcartes, M. Gaſſendi, Father Maignan,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>As we were taken up with the Curioſity of all theſe different Pieces of Sculpture and Painting, the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the Place came in to give us Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46662:63"/>Never was Man ſo much ſurprized as my <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> at firſt Sight of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; he had formerly known him in <hi>Holland,</hi> when he there accompanied <hi>M.

               <note place="margin">Diſſert. de Meth.</note> after he had finiſhed his <hi>Courſe of Philoſophy,</hi> in the <hi>Colledge de la Fleche,</hi> ceaſed not to be a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> thereupon; nay pretends he commenc'd one but from that Time. As he was fully convinced there was far leſs to be gained from the moſt curious of Books and Libraries than from the great Volume of the World, the moſt Compleat and Inſtructive of all others, to ſuch as know how to ſtudy it as they ought; he pitch'd upon Travel. During nine or ten Years he run through moſt Countries; frequented the Court, as alſo the Armies of moſt Foreign Princes: But ſtill as a <hi>Philoſopher, i. e.</hi> continually making ſerious Reflections upon the Intellectual and Moral Part of Man, upon the different Cuſtoms of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46662:64"/>upon the contrary Judgments Men make of the ſelf-ſame things, conformably to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notions they have imbibed concerning them, endeavouring always herein to alembeck Truth from Falſhood, and to advantage himſelf equally by the Folly and Wiſdom of other Men; that he might collect a Syſtem of Life, compoſed and regulated by defecated Reaſon, whoſe Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as far as poſſible, ſhould be independent of the Turns and Wheels of Fortune.</p>
            <p>He began to put his Project in Execution, in a certain Place in <hi>Germany,</hi> which he does not name, where he paſſed the Winter, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the <hi>Coronation</hi> of the Emperor <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> III. where cloſeting himſelf whole Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Stove, he recollected in his Mind all the Obſervations he had made, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mankind; which he imployed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his Rules of Morality, as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his Book, entituled, <hi>Diſſertation de la me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode de bien uſer de ſa raiſon.</hi> From whence paſſing to <hi>Metaphyſical Notices,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> he laid the Scheme to the moſt part of his Works he ſince hath left us; making at the ſame Time an Eſſay of his Phyſicks, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Explanation of the Motion of the Heart and Arteries, which certainly is not the worſt Piece we have of his Works.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Next he deliberated what Place was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for a Settlement; he was byaſſed againſt his ſtay in <hi>Britanny,</hi> his Native Country, where his Family then bore, as it does to this Day, a conſiderable Port, foreſeeing the Incumbrances he ſhould find among his Relations, would ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably retard his vehement Purſuit of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> In fine, he reſolved on <hi>Holland,</hi> as a Retreat
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46662:64"/>freeſt from Diſturbance, where every one, <hi>ſaid be,</hi> minds his own concerns, without medling with other Men's; and where the Maintenance of thoſe numerous Troops, ſerved but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend with more Security to the whole Country the Advantages of Peace, in the midſt of a rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War.</p>
            <p>He paſſed near eight Years in Peace and Quiet,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> making his ordinary abode at <hi>Egmond,</hi> a little Town on the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> inſomuch that during all that Space he never left the Country, but on the account of his Domeſtick Occaſions, that indiſpenſibly oblig'd him to make ſome Journies into <hi>France.</hi> Happy,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>20.</hi>
               </note> if his Zeal for the Publick Good, and his Compaſſion for the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Condition of Philoſophy, had not made him tranſgreſs that excellent <hi>Moral Maxim</hi> he had preſcribed himſelf, to leave the World as he found it, without endeavouring to reform it, or rectifie its Ideas, to think only of finding Truth for himſelf, and of conquering his own Paſſions; but he was worſted firſt by that of Printing, and after by all the other, Authors are ſubject to, when they find their Opinions contradicted: For it muſt be confeſſed, although <hi>M.

            <p>No ſooner had he impreſſed his <hi>Dioptriques,</hi> and his <hi>Meteors;</hi> Next that, his <hi>Diſſertation concerning Method,</hi> and ſince his <hi>Meditations:</hi> But he found himſelf ſet upon from all Hands; all the <hi>

            <p>But all this was nothing in compariſon with his great Concernment at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where <hi>Voetius</hi> fell like a Lion looſe upon him. <hi>Voetius</hi> was one of the Supports of the <hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46662:65"/>in the Town. 'Tis known what they were in regard of the <hi>New Philoſophy,</hi> which was the Reaſon why thoſe of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Party durſt not declare themſelves: Notwithſtanding, at laſt, <hi>Regius</hi> the Phyſician, whom <hi>Deſcartes</hi> ſtyles,<note place="margin">Lett. de Deſc.</note> his <hi>Proto-martyr,</hi> could no longer ſtifle the Hatred he had conceived againſt Subſtantial Forms; he affixed his <hi>Theſes,</hi> wherein he had baniſhed them, to ſubſtitute in their Room the different Configuration of the inſenſible Parts of every Body.

            </p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Voetius</hi> ſlept not in an Affair of this Importance; he went to the firſt Diſputes of <hi>Regius,</hi> ſuborned a great many Scholars he had gained, and placed them in ſeveral Parts of the Hall; who as ſoon as <hi>Regius</hi> his Diſciple began to talk of <hi>Subtil Matter, of the Balls of the Second Element, of Ramous and Chamfer'd Particles,</hi> burſt out a Laughing, ſet up an Hiſs, clapt their Hands, and were ſeconded by the <hi>Doctors,</hi> the Friends of <hi>Voetius:</hi> That tumultuous Outcry diſmounted poor <hi>Regius,</hi> and obliged him to cut off his Diſputations.

            <p>

            <p>That Blow went with <hi>M.

That turned the Bent of <hi>Voetius</hi>'s Fury on himſelf, who quitting thenceforward <hi>Regius,</hi> whom he ſaw foiled and groveling, and looked upon as a Forlorn-Hope, ſent out to Piqueer and Skirmiſh, by <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> thought he muſt double his Forces to make an On-ſet on this New Sect, and aſſault it in its Leader. As ill Fortune ſtill would have it, <hi>Deſcartes</hi> and <hi>Regius</hi> fell to Swords-points, and ſharpned their Quills againſt each other, as if it had been the Fate of that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> at that Time, to have all the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46662:66"/>Learned Men of <hi>Holland</hi> for his Enemies, whoſe Names did terminate in <hi>Ius, Revius, Demma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> the two <hi>Voetius</hi>'s and <hi>Regius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing that was done at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Let. de Deſe.</note> was to damn <hi>Deſcartes</hi> in all Companies as an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, as another <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who under pretence of eſtabliſhing by his Arguments the Exiſtence of a God, aim'd only to rout and confute it. <hi>Voe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> declaim'd eternally againſt him in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, in his Diſputations, in his Sermons. He pitch'd purpoſely on Theſes of Atheiſm, where he brought in every thing that might bring an Odium on <hi>Deſcartes.</hi> And ſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did they decry him, that when the News of his Death arriv'd ſeveral Years after at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> Prejudice was ſo deeply rooted, as to make an addition of dreadful Circumſtances, and it was the Current Report of the Town, That he dyed the moſt impious and wicked Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in the World, without Faith, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, like <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Voetius</hi> indeavour'd to uncement the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends he had,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> des Let. de Deſc.</note> and as much a Proteſtant Miniſter as he was, wrote to <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to enter in a League with him, and to excite him to write againſt <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> but ſped not in that Negotiation. He accus'd him of being a Clandeſtine <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the Country, and ſeem'd by that to be willing to impeach him as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the State. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he was an Emiſſary and Spy of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and held an Epiſtolary Correſpondence with them, and produc'd one Letter, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which he had wrote to <hi>Father Dinet,</hi> ſometime after <hi>Confeſſor</hi> to the King. So true it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46662:67"/>is that <hi>Titus Oats</hi> is not the firſt that thought of perſuading the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of his Country, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> gave Commiſſions in <hi>England</hi> to levy an Army,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur.

            <p>In ſhort; <hi>Voetius</hi> partly by his Reputation and Vogue, partly by his Intrigues, brought it about, that <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Philoſophy ſhould be condemn'd throughout the Univerſity, of which he was Rector: He cited him by the order of the Magiſtrates, with a great noiſe, at the ſound of a Bell, by the notice of a Bedel, to come and anſwer to the Calumnies he was ſaid to have written againſt <hi>Voetius.</hi> In ſo much that his Friends advis'd him to be upon his Guard, as being ſcarce ſecure in the place where he was, though it was out of the Reach and Juriſdiction of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> Two Papers, wherein <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> mention'd <hi>Voetius,</hi> one of which was the Letter he had wrote to <hi>Father Dinet,</hi> were declared diffamatory Libels. That Declaration was Printed, and affix'd and ſent to the principal Towns of the United Provinces. If we may believe <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> there was no leſs Deſign on Foot, than the Baniſhing him all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a Decree, the loading him with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fines, the burning his Books by the Hand of the common Hangman, to which, ſome ſaid, <hi>Voetius</hi> had reſolv'd to make ſo great a Fire in burning of them, as the Flame of it ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all the Countries thereabouts. In a word, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was forc'd to get clear of theſe Troubles, to imploy the credit of his Friends, and the Intereſt of the <hi>French Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> that might hinder it from proceeding any farther.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:46662:67"/>
            <p>Theſe Quarrels were kept up many Years; and <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> foreſeeing the Apologies he he deſign'd to have preſented to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> to juſtifie himſelf, and demand the reparation of his Honour, would be ineffectual in the procuring ſuch ſatisfaction as he pretended due to him, thought often of leaving <hi>Holland,</hi> where he found not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he at firſt propos'd to himſelf. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he received from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi> at that time, with the promiſe of a good Penſion, if he would come and live at <hi>Paris,</hi> determin'd him to depart: But the Troubles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unluckily ſtop'd the Career of his good Fortune. Letters were ſent him in Parchment curiouſly ſeal'd, and full of the greateſt Praiſes in the World: But that was all; nor had he his Letters <hi>gratis.</hi> Never Parchment, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſays, coſt him ſo dear, and was ſo unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as that: Nothing could hinder him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his beloved <hi>Holland,</hi> without fear of falling afreſh into the Hands of <hi>Voetius, Schook</hi> and <hi>Revius:</hi> But not long after, the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sueden</hi> ſent for him to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where 'tis vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly ſaid he dy'd.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto ſaid of the difference of <hi>Voetius</hi> with <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> has been taken for the moſt part out of the Letters of that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. <hi>Voetius</hi> inform'd us in the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> of the other Particulars that concern'd himſelf, to wit, That after <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Holland,</hi> he grew reconcil'd to <hi>Regius</hi> the Phyſitian, who in the Feaſt of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as a Badge of the real Intentions of his future Friendſhip, preſented him with ſome of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Snuſh,</hi> which he often made uſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46662:68"/>of, but eſpecially to come to the <hi>Lyceum</hi> in the <hi>Moon;</hi> that having highly merited of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by thoſe famous Exploits manag'd againſt <hi>Regius</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> in the Defence of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philoſophy, that <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him the Imploy we ſaw him in poſſeſſion of; that he nevertheleſs wav'd the accepting of it, till, underſtanding that <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Soul left no Stone unturn'd to bring the Souls of theſe Parts over to him, his Zeal for the <hi>Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> had wrought upon him to quit his Body, in order to oppoſe the Deſigns of that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that very <hi>Voetius</hi> that was formerly the Hero of <hi>Peripateciſm</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Our Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithſtanding was extraordinary civil on both Hands; and after our mutual Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to each other, he expreſs'd the Joy he had to hear <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was hatching no ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon the <hi>Lyceum of the Moon.</hi> He confeſs'd likewiſe the Regret he had for urging that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher heretofore ſo far: But that his own Reputation in <hi>Holland</hi> was incompatible with <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s. That if he had once permitted the <hi>new Philoſophy,</hi> to take Footing in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> he muſt either have been oblig'd to learn it, or hold his Tongue in all Diſputes: And he found much uneaſineſs to conſent to one or the other: That he was then too old to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Scholar; and that it was eaſily gueſs'd how ungrateful a Task it had been for an old <hi>Philoſophy Profeſſor,</hi> to hear all his Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſputed, without the Priviledg of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, at leaſt by way of Arguing; for that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> having thrown out of Doors the Terms made uſe of in the Schools, he had been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46662:68"/>oblig'd in all publick Acts, to ſtand as a Perſon that was Deaf and Dumb: He that had always been renown'd for his Subtilty and Penetration. That he had obſerv'd in his Philoſophy many good Things, among abundance of others that ſeem'd ſomewhat hard. And that having often diſcours'd <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concerning that Philoſophy, they had both concluded it would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make ſome Accommodation, and if we were willing, it would be no trouble to him, to enter in a particular Conference thereupon: We gladly embrac'd his Offer, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving order'd his Attendants to retire, he ſpoke as follows:</p>
            <p>You may eaſily ſee, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> by the Rank I hold there, I have a great ſhare in the Favours of the <hi>Prince</hi> our <hi>Soveraign:</hi> I have yet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Conſidence: You will readily think ſo, by one Profeſſion he has made me, and which I am well aſſur'd I may ſafely venture to make you in his Name. It is this, That his Intereſts are indeed cloſely united with the Intereſts of thoſe Philoſophers that write themſelves <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians,</hi> but at the bottom they are no more the ſame than are their Sentiments in point of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy: But notwithſtanding he hath hitherto diſpens'd with the Promiſcuous confounding of them. The Pleaſure, and at once the Honour to ſee himſelf Marching at the Head of all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> that with an unanimous Conſent attributed to him the Quality of their Prince, was well worth the trouble of conniving at the diametrical Repugnance he ſaw in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of moſt of thoſe, who declar'd to be intirely his. That diviſion it ſelf, which was to be found among his moſt zealous <hi>Partiſans,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:46662:69"/>who took it to be a greater Honour, and made it of more Concernment to have ingag'd him on their ſide, than Truth it ſelf, did not a little contribute to his Glory: To ſee himſelf inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently on Reaſon, by the ſole weight of his Authority made Umpire of all the diſagreeing Philoſophers; to injoy peaceably the Priviledg of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> among thoſe that diſputed it with <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> had ſomething charming in it, that induced him to think it beſt to be contented, without being much concern'd at their taking or miſtaking of his meaning; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatever they ſay, he only, by the Voice of both Parties was always in the right. But ſince that <hi>M. Deſoartes, M. Gaſſendi,</hi> and ſome others, have thrown off the Yoak of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to juſtifie their Conduct have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and with Succeſs enough, to ſhew the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, or the unſoundneſs of ſome Opinions of the Schools, of which they pretend to make him the Warantee, becauſe the beſt of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have awarded them unto him with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent: He hath thought fit to declare himſelf on the firſt occaſion, and to intreat the <hi>Publick,</hi> as alſo thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> the <hi>new Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> to do him Juſtice in that Particular. He proteſts then to ſeparate his. Intereſt in many Articles from theirs, that ſtyle themſelves his Diſciples: He declares that in the <hi>Queſtions</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> many things go under his Name which are none of his; as is for Inſtance, that moſt Childiſh Notion of the <hi>Horror of a Vacuum.</hi> That he himſelf hath certify'd and prov'd by Experience, the Preſſure of the Air, which at this Day is made a Principle in the Phyſical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilcation of ſuch <hi>Phenomena's,</hi> as have moſt alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46662:69"/>to the Queſtion of a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> That he is no ways the Father of an infinite little Beings, introduc'd in the School Philoſophy. That his Writings have often been miſ-interpreted, and Men have commonly taken for Natural Beings, what in his <hi>Idea</hi> were only Denominations and Metaphyſical Attributes.</p>
            <p>This Calm, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> with which I ſpeak, after that ungovernable Obſtinacy you formerly knew me guilty of, might ſtand for my Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, as to you, in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Abſence: But I will farther add, that ſince you meet him out of the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> he hath diſpatch'd an Expreſs, in which he gives orders, that if you paſs'd this way, I ſhould not fail to inform you of his Thoughts and Intentions, and to let you know that whatever Warmth appear'd in him in his Diſcourſe againſt <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> he would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding gladly hearken to ſome Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with him: Furthermore this is no unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Reſolution. The Expedient has been form'd, and written long ago, and the Fault will not be ours if you do not ſee it, and take upon you the preſenting it to <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> if you ſo think convenient. We return'd, we moſt joyfully accepted it, and that we thought our ſelves happy any ways to contribute to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of the <hi>two greateſt Philoſophers</hi> the World has known, and the Reunion of two Parties, that were at preſent the only conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in <hi>Europe.</hi> He took forthwith out of a Cabinet that was at the end of the Hall, and where, upon handſom Shelves, ſtood a good ſight of Books, excellently bound, and that look'd exactly like Books the new Philoſophers have compos'd, within this thirty or forty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46662:70"/>Years, and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Voetius</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly read; he took, I ſay, from a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, a kind of <hi>Memoirs,</hi> with this Title in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Words, <hi>De Conſenſu Philoſophiae Veteris &amp; Novae.</hi> We have, ſaid I, an Ingenious Man of our World, that has wrote a Book with the ſame Inſcription.<note place="margin">M. Du Hamel.</note> I my ſelf have read it <hi>(he replyed)</hi> and a Man may eaſily ſee by the way it is wrote in, the Author is well vers'd in all parts of Philoſophy. He is a Gentleman unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed as to one ſide or other, is throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Intereſts of each Party, and therefore the fitteſt Perſon that I know to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate in that Affair. A preliminary Point is taken from his Preface, which is much in the right on't, and whereto <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes</hi> muſt forthwith accord; that the Sect-Leaders of Philophy, <hi>Neque omnia, neque nihil viderunt.</hi> With that he preſented us the Project of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and deſired us to read it at our leiſure, in our <hi>Voyage;</hi> as alſo to take with us, as we had offered at our Arrival, ſome <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian Souls,</hi> to accompany us to <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Place of Reſidence, to the end he might know by them, what that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> had reſolv'd upon the Propoſitions laid down in that Treaty. We thanked him for the Honour he did us, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting us with ſo Important a Negotiation; aſſured him, we would do all that lay in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the facilitating its Succeſs; and after much Expreſſion and Acknowledgment of his Civilities, we beg'd his leave we might perſue our <hi>Voyage,</hi> ſince we had a vaſt way ſtill to go, and had ſpent many Hours in that we had paſs'd already. He conducted us out of the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> and giving ſome Inſtructions to two Souls of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46662:70"/>the Country, that ſeem'd Spirits of Note and Faſhion, ordered them to wait on us, ſo made his <hi>Conge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deſigning to run over that whole <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> that is oppos'd to <hi>our Earth,</hi> we kept on our Road to the North, and leaving <hi>Democritus</hi> on the left, we paſs'd through <hi>Thales,</hi> and drove on quite to <hi>Zoroaster;</hi> from whence we made a double towards the Weſt, through deſert Lands, where we ſaw the ruins of ſome ancient Towns, as of <hi>Atlas, Cepheus, Hermes,</hi> without meeting Man, Woman or Child, till we came to the <hi>Lake of Dreams,</hi> on whoſe Banks we found three ſeparate Spirits, with whom we were taken up one Moment in Diſcourſe, as we paſſed along.</p>
            <p>We ſurprized the two firſt, ſtoutly Curſing and Banning their Wives they had formerly in the World. One of which was, that <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> mention'd by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Body abed, to make a Ramble, as his Cuſtom was, his Wife, that did not love him, ſlipt not the opportunity of calling up her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to whom ſhe ſhewed, not without tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Hair and playing the Mad-woman, the Body of her Husband unſoul'd and breathleſs, and carried the Humour on ſo well, that the Body was burnt, according to the cuſtom of the Country, before the Soul return'd, who was from thenceforth forced to ſeek another Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The other Spirit was a <hi>Roman Senator,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Lamia,</hi> whoſe Wife had trickt out of the World by the ſame Project, though, a little more it had miſcarried. For as he related it, The Soul being returned to look its Body, where
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46662:71"/>'twas left, not finding it, and ſeeing the Family Mourning, begun to ſmell how the Matter ſtood: It Poſted preſently to the place where was built the Funeral Pile to burn the Body, and arriv'd there, juſt as the Fire began to ſeize it. The Soul thought it inconvenient to reunite her ſelf with it, for fear it might be obliged to be burnt alive, ſhe only mov'd its Tongue, ſo as many of the Standers by heard theſe Words twice diſtinctly repeated, <hi>I am not dead, I am not dead.</hi> But ſeeing the Maſters of the Funeral Ceremonies, who had undoubtedly received an <hi>Item</hi> from the Dame, unconcerned as 'ere, ſhe left it to be burnt, and came to fix in the <hi>Globe of the Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, whom we found two Leagues farther in a ghaſtly Grot, was the famous <hi>John Duns Scotus,</hi> commonly called <hi>Scot,</hi> or the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Doctor.</hi> He has paſs'd for a dead Man unto this day, on which Account ſome have given out moſt ridiculous Stories, and highly diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Reputation of ſo worthy a Perſon, and which have ſtill been well confuted. But the truth is that he is not dead; and that having by the ſubtilty of his Mind, found out the Secret ſo many others have procured, his Corps was taken for dead, and was buried in the abſence of his Soul, which took Sanctuary in the <hi>Globe of the Moon.</hi> He was incompaſs'd by a Croud of little (I know not what you call them, for they were not <hi>Beings,</hi> but I think) <hi>Formalities.</hi> He was the firſt Father of them in the <hi>Philoſophical World,</hi> and he that gave them firſt Repute. They be the prettyeſt, littleſt, ſlender,—you'd think them next to <hi>nothing.</hi> Perceiving we were Philoſophers, to be a little
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46662:71"/>more affable than ordinary, he began to ask us what we thought of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal a parte rei,</hi> and whether we did not take it to be <hi>Objective Preciſions?</hi> Our <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> who beſides his <hi>Carteſian Ideas</hi> upon Philoſophy, had ſtill a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of that gruff and ſurly Humour <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Compliments had provok'd, anſwered him in a careleſs Air, We concern not our Heads much with ſuch inſipid Trifles; that it was but <hi>Iriſh Gibbriſh,</hi> and that none of us had any Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Elogy <hi>Buchanan</hi> gives his Country Philoſphers, otherwiſe Men of Senſe and Worth,
<q>Gens ratione furens &amp; mentem paſta Chimeris.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Trifles and Chimera's, reply'd <hi>Scotus!</hi> They are the fineſt and moſt ſolid Queſtions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. By this it was we diſtinguiſhed our ſelves in my time; by that Subtilty wherewith I handled theſe Queſtions, I was advanced to the quality of <hi>Doctor Subtilis.</hi> Trifles and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras, quoth a! You <hi>French</hi> Philoſophers, have you ever read the Hiſtory of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris?</hi> If you have not read it, read it: You will ſee if theſe things were look'd on hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Trifles. You will ſee under the Reign of the young <hi>Lewis,</hi> one <hi>Rouſſelin</hi> of <hi>Britanny,</hi> it the Head of the <hi>Nominals,</hi> diſputing Hand to Fiſt in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> againſt thoſe who held an Univerſal <hi>a parte rei,</hi> and from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they came to Swords, that there was Man ſlaughter in the Caſe. You will ſee, what I have been told is done, ſince I quit your World. That in the reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Eleventh,</hi> the Court and Parliament interpoſed themſelves
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46662:72"/>in Philoſophical Differences, which you call Trifles; that by the order of the King, the Books of the <hi>Nominals</hi> were chain'd and pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd, ſtrictly prohibiting the opening them ever after: And I would to God, thoſe Decrees had not been repeal'd by the Aſſerters of that empty Philoſophy, which will have Univerſality conſiſt in Names and Conceptions: Then at this day I ſhould have reign'd abſolute in the Schools.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(continu'd he)</hi> taking Courage, Are not you of that Party of Philoſophers I have heard talk of ſome time ſince, and whoſe Works I have likewiſe ſeen in a Viſit I made <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who have a certain <hi>Britiſh Cavilier</hi> for their Leader, called <hi>Deſcartes?</hi> Yea verily, <hi>reply'd our old</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian, and we take it as an Honour ſo to be. Be gone, cry'd he, all in a Rage and Paſſion! Away with you! Hence Hereticks, as you are, who take it for an Honour to be of a Sect, which by its Principles is oblig'd to renounce the Faith of our moſt Holy Myſteries. Your <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> holds that a determinate Extenſion is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a Body, and that a Body being once of the ſize of a Cubical Foot, it would be as great a Contradiction to loſe that Extenſion, as to conceive a Mountain without a Valley.

            <p>That his extraordinary Zeal was no leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing than diverting. But that which pleas'd me moſt, was, That upon our leaving that place, the two <hi>Ariſtotelian Souls</hi> which <hi>Voetius</hi> had deputed to accompany us, began by the way to reſume the Argument of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and to urge it vigourouſly againſt <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> and my <hi>old Man,</hi> who were much perplexed to rid their Hands of it. But they propoſed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the manner whereby <hi>M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and after him <hi>M. Rohault</hi> undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Myſtery of the Euchariſt, without the aſſiſtance of <hi>abſolute Accidents;</hi> which may merit a place in this Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> in his Anſwer to the fourth Set of Objections, propos'd againſt his Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Meditations, explains the Myſtery of the Euchariſt as follows. He ſays, That the Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> after the Conſecration, is in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame place the Bread was in before; but that it is ſo preciſely in the ſame ſpace, that in what place ſoever, it was true to affirm before the Conſecration, here is Bread; it is true to ſay after the Conſecration, here is the Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> So that if we conceive that before the Conſecration there was, whether in the Surface or in the Subſtance of the Bread, little Pirami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Cubical or Triangular Spaces, fill'd with Piramidal, Cubical or Triangular Parts of Bread, we muſt conceive, after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe little Spaces are poſſeſſed in the ſame exactneſs by the Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> From whence it follows, according to him, That when 'tis ſaid the Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> is comprehended in the ſame Dimenſions, and the very Superficies as the Bread, by that word Superficies is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46662:73"/>not only that external Surface that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the total Figure of the Bread, but alſo that which terminates all the parts which are in the depth and ſubſtance of it, ſeparated from one another by the Pores, and little Intervals that are fill'd up with Air, or ſome other Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies: In ſo much that ſhould ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible parts of the Bread be put in motion by the Air, or ſome other Body, the new Subſtance, that takes the place of thoſe inſenſible Parts, is equally put in Motion.</p>
            <p>Upon that Suppoſition <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> argues thus. Whatever makes an Impreſſion upon our Senſes is only the Superficies of a Body. Every Body therefore that has the ſame Superficies as the Bread, will make the ſame Impreſſions on our Senſes as the Bread. Therefore ſince the Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> is ſo preciſely in the ſame ſpace as the Bread, that it hath the ſame Superficies to an Hair, it muſt inevitably make the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on our Senſes as the Bread, that is, it muſt reflect the Light, as the Bread did, and with the ſame Modifications: And from hence we ſee in it the ſame Colour and the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. It muſt be preſs'd towards the Centre of the Earth, by the Impulſe of the ſame Matter that preſſed the Bread before, becauſe of the Figuration of its Parts of which it was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and hence we perceive in it the ſame Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. It muſt vibrate the Nerves of our Tongue, and inſinuate it ſelf into the Pores, juſt as did the inſenſible parts of the Bread; and hence we apprehend in it the ſame Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence he concludes, That Myſtery may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably explained, without the incumbrance of abſolute Accidents, which are kept in ſervice without any occaſion for them.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:46662:73"/>
            <p>See then one Difficulty among many others our <hi>Peripateticks</hi> propoſed againſt that Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we will demonſtrate <hi>(ſaid they)</hi> that, granting that <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the Bread is not at all changed into the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but that after the Conſecration, the Bread ſtill remains in the Hoſt.</p>
            <p>In order to their Demonſtration they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> and <hi>the old Gentleman:</hi> I. Whether by the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> the Matter of all Bodies conſidered in it ſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of the different Modifications of its Parts was not of the ſame Species? They anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Yes. II. If that which conſtituted the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Difference of Bodies was not, according to them, the different Configuration, the different Situation, and the different Motions of the Parts of thoſe Bodies? They acknowledged it. That ſuppoſed, <hi>ſaid they,</hi> we'll evidently prove, That the Subſtance in the Euchariſt, after its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, is nothing elſe but Bread; for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the Subſtance, which hath the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of Parts, the ſame Motion, and in a Word, all the ſame Modifications that conſtitute the Eſſence of Bread, is Bread, according to the aforeſaid Principle: But the Subſtance found in the Dimenſions of the Hoſt, after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has all thoſe Modifications; and 'tis only by the Means of thoſe Modifications we conceive it to have the ſame Superficies as the Bread, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word Superficies in the ſame Senſe <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> gives it: And 'tis in vertue of thoſe Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications that that Superficies makes the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on our Senſes as the Bread did before the Conſecration: And 'tis from the ſame Reaſon that it reflects its Light preciſely to the ſame
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46662:74"/>Angles as the Bread: That it receives all the ſame Impulſes, and the ſame Determinations of the Matter, that puſhes it towards the Centre, as the Bread: That it communicates the ſame Vibrations to the Nerves of the Tongue as the Bread: Therefore the Subſtance that is in the Space of the Hoſt, after the Conſecration, according to <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles, has the Form or the Eſſence of Bread; therefore it is Bread, which was to be demonſtrated. And from thence our Catholick <hi>Peripateticks</hi> concluded, It was not without good Ground that Recourſe was had to <hi>Abſolute Accidents,</hi> in the Explication of that Myſtery.</p>
            <p>They made yet one Reflection more upon a Saying <hi>Deſcartes</hi> adjoyns to his Explication, and which ruines his Anſwer. <q>Notwithſtanding, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſpeak properly, is not there, as in a Place, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally.</q> For, ſaid they, What is it, for God's ſake, to be in a Place in proper ſpeaking, but entirely to fill a Space? to hinder the Paſſage of other Bodies that preſent themſelves; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the Light, to be preſſed downward; to have Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all this, according to <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> agrees to the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament of the Hoſt. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Notion commonly received of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Exiſtence attributes not to a Body in that Capacity all thoſe Properties; for none of thoſe that have ſpoke of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in the Sacrament, have ſuppoſed it was that which reflects the Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, they ſay the quite contrary.</p>
            <p>So they concluded, deriding the Vanity of the Applauſe <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> aſſumes to himſelf in that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46662:74"/>Place, upon the Intelligible Manner, wherewith he pretends to have explained that Myſtery, and upon the Obligations he has laid on the <hi>Orthodox Divines,</hi> for having furniſhed them with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more agreeable with <hi>Divinity</hi> than thoſe uſually received. Applauſe, as well grounded as the Prophecy he made a little after, by which one Day it ſhall come to paſs, that as ſoon as the World ſhall be reclaimed from the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of the <hi>School,</hi> all the Opinions of our Old <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> thereupon, ſhall diſappear and vaniſh as Shadows, at the Approach of that Light, wherewith thoſe Glorious Principles of the New Philoſophy ſhall fill the Minds of all ſuch as know how well to uſe them.</p>
            <p>For my part, I was of Opinion, upon hearing <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> ſo refuted, that he had better have ſtuck to his general Anſwer, be it as bad as it will, That he was a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and not a <hi>Divine,</hi> and that he pretended not to explain the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our <hi>Religion</hi> by the Principles of his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</hi> I was aſtoniſhed too in that Occurrence, That ſuch ſort of Anſwers had the good Luck to meet with no Reply, eſpecially having to do with <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> who would never willingly take the laſt Blow in Point of Diſputes and Books. But I am perſuaded I have ſince found the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Difficulty in a Letter <hi>M. Decſartes</hi> wrote to a <hi>Father of the Oratory,</hi> a <hi>Sorbon Doctor.</hi> He ſays, ſpeaking of <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> That his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judgment, as young a Doctor as he was, was of more Weight with him, than that of half the Ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi> Was not a Clearing of that nature able to diſarm the moſt incenſed Adverſary in the World?</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:46662:75"/>
            <p>During that Diſpute, wherein <hi>Father Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the Old Blade thought it unneceſſary to keep to Mood and Figure, and were content to evade the Objection by much raillery upon <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Accidents,</hi> alledging they ought to be baniſh'd to the Deſert of <hi>Scotus,</hi> to make up his Train and Attendance, with all his little <hi>Formalities;</hi> We croſſed the <hi>Calm Sea,</hi> and turning ſhort to the Right, we paſſed through <hi>Hipparchus, Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi> and the <hi>Peninſula of the Stars,</hi> and from thence we cut through the <hi>Sea of Clouds.</hi> We entred into the <hi>Demy-Iſland of Dreams,</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the beginning; ſo called from the little Manſions in the Globe of the Moon, inhabited for the moſt Part with <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> that are in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> having not been able to find it upon Earth; and a World of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Aſtrologers,</hi> who ſtill are as great Aſſes as they were in the other World, and ſpend all their Time in making <hi>Almanacks,</hi> and correcting by exact Supputations the falſe <hi>Horoſcopes</hi> they made in their Life time.</p>
            <p>Among others we found <hi>Cardan,</hi> who though he was poſſeſſed of a good Copy-hold Eaſtward, on the Shoar of the <hi>Ocean of Tempeſts,</hi> could not yet forbear making frequent Viſits of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſame Society. He paſſed away his Time but diſcontentedly, having not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Shagrin and Melancholy, occaſioned by that Notable <hi>Horoſcope of</hi> Edward <hi>VI. King of</hi> England, whoſe moſt remarkable Fortunes and Adventures he had foretold, quite to the Fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Year of his Age, who yet had the confounded Luck to die at Fifteen. Two other things, much of the ſame Nature, entertained his Thoughts in that deep Melancholy: The firſt was the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46662:75"/>Death of his Son, whoſe Horoſcope had proved Faulty, he having not foreſeen what yet came to paſs, That he ſhould be executed at <hi>Milan,</hi> in the four and twentieth Year of his Age, for poyſoning his Wife. The other thing was the uncharitable behaviour of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Thou,</hi> in publiſhing in their Books to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, That he was ſuffered to dye with Hunger: For after all, <hi>ſaid he to us,</hi> they are Lyars, for were <hi>I dead,</hi> 'twas impoſſible I ſhould be here. I muſt confeſs, that having foretold the Day of my Death, in my Horoſcope, I made my ſelf, and finding I was miſtaken, ſeeing at the Time preſcribed no Sign or Symptom of approaching Death, I ſhut my ſelf in my Cloſet; and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſidence to appear from thenceforth in the Sight of Men, ſince every Moment of my Life to come had been the continual Reproach of my Miſtake, I even reſolved to quit my Body, and come and inhabit here. And this, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> is the real Truth of the Matter. We took occaſion to extenuate the Cauſes of his Affliction, by telling him of the Reputation he always had, with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to all that, in the World, as an extraordinary Man, and diſtinguiſhed from the Vulgar: After which we took our Leave of him, and poſted from thence to <hi>Merſennus,</hi> where we launched for our Voyage over the Moon. There it was that the two Philoſophers ſtepping aſide for ſome Moments, we read, altogether, the Project of Accommodation betwixt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> which <hi>Voetius</hi> had given us charge of, and whoſe principal Articles I ſhall here relate. It was divided into two Parts; The firſt was to regulate the Method, how the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> and <hi>Carteſians</hi> muſt for the future
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46662:76"/>demean themſelves towards one another, in their Books, Diſputes and Converſations. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which was very long, contained ſeveral Propoſitions, that the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> remitted, to make ſome Advances nearer the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the like Abatements from the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> whereby they might approach better the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians.</hi> That Second Part was rather a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of many <hi>Carteſian</hi> Opinions than a Treaty of Accommodation, which gave me to conjecture it would fail of the Succeſs they promiſed to themſelves, or at leaſt pretended to propoſe themſelves. 'Tis eaſie to ſee that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Voetius</hi> his Secretary was well informed of our Sublunary Occurrences, and what was for and againſt his Party and his Adverſary's.</p>

                  <p>On the other Hand the Old Profeſſors of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy muſt remember to be more ſparing of their Epithets, of which they are commonly too liberal on <hi>Carteſius</hi> his Account; conſtantly ſtyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>Enthuſiaſt, Madman,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Atheiſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> complained forthwith of the Delicacy of the firſt <hi>Carteſians,</hi> who thought it adviſable to take Diſguſt at the very Name of <hi>Substantial Forms.</hi> For ſuppoſe, ſaid he, that no more was meant by that Word than the Principle of the Properties of every Body, and that which is the Cauſe why one Body ſo differs from another, that Uſe has given it a particular Name, and made it a Species diſtinct from other Kinds of Bodies: What hath that Term ſo Diſtaſtful and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46662:78"/>As to the Idea the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have affixed to it, making it to ſpeak, an <hi>Incomplete Subſtance distinct from Matter;</hi> he ſaid, That Definition being no where to be found in his Writings, at leaſt in expreſs Terms, he might, if he thought good, diſown it, and devolve upon the <hi>Arabian Commentators,</hi> as on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that <hi>Being,</hi> all the Railleries and fine Things pretended to be ſpoke by the <hi>new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> on that Chapter. But that he was not yet in that Humour, the <hi>Carteſians</hi> having concluded nothing rationally againſt that Syſtem. That an <hi>Incomplete Subſtance</hi> was no <hi>Chimera,</hi> ſince the reaſonable Soul in Man is undoubtedly ſo. That their grand <hi>Axiom</hi> brought to demoliſh <hi>Subſtantial material Forms,</hi> viz. Whatever is Material is Matter; was palpably falſe, as they have been anſwered an hundred times, ſeeing Motion and Figure, which are material Things, are notwithſtanding devoid of Matter; and alſo that he lookt upon the ordinary Doctrin of <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> as his true Doctrin. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, adjoyn'd he, we ſhall ſee what uſe <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> will make of it, and what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he will offer on his part. When he ſhall have granted Brutes a Soul, the Peripateticks will conſider whether they ſhall recede from ſome other Point.</p>
                  <p>Upon which, he brought many Arguments to perſuade him to be leſs hardy and intractable thereupon. He repreſented how that Article of his Philoſophy had ſhockt the whole World. That his earneſtneſs and zeal for that Opinion had been excuſable, if he had been the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but it is well known a Spaniard, called <hi>Pereyra,</hi> firſt lit upon that Notion; and ſome
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46662:78"/>were ſo malicious as to ſay, he had drawn it from the Spaniard's Book before he deduc'd it from his own Principles. That he had already gain'd, by that Opinion, as much Honour as could be expected; that it was lookt upon in the World as an Ingenious Paradox, on which he and his Diſciples had deſcanted very ſubtly, and had ſufficiently plagu'd and tormented the School Philoſophers; but that the latter and more intelligent ſort of Men could not forbear Laughing, when they ſeriouſly undertook to maintain it as a Truth. That 'twas known this was the firſt Effect the Preface to a Book, Entituled, <hi>The Soul of Beaſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L' Ame des Betes.</note> produced in the Mind of its Readers. A Book wrote indeed with a great deal of Wit, but wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor too ſeriouſly drives at the Converſion of the Philoſophers upon that Subject. That no one had brought one ſubſtantial Reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the prejudice of all Mankind in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. That no one had yet demonſtrated that a middle Being, betwixt Spirit and Matter, was a thing impoſſible. That the Promiſe the <hi>Carteſians</hi> had made, to explain all that we ſee admirable in Beaſts, by the ſole diſpoſition of the <hi>Machine</hi> was whimſical, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on, ſince it never had been put in Practice. That when they talked of theſe Matters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they ſometimes ſpoke plauſibly enough; but when they deſcended to Particulars, they were either much to be pitied or not endured. That the only Idea of the manner of Brutes acting on infinite occaſions, compared with that Paradox, made it look extravagant. That whereas 'twas anſwered, that Argument prov'd too much, and made for the reaſoning of Beaſts;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46662:79"/>it muſt be acknowledged that Inſtance perplex'd the Philoſophers, and gave them trouble to get clear off; yet after all, whatever pain it put them to, their Argument loſt nothing of its Force; and the Inſtance on the other hand infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely increaſed the difficulty. For if it be hard to comprehend, that Beaſts ſhould not have Reaſon, upon ſeeing them act in ſo admirable and methodical a manner, how much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult would it be to deny them bare Perception? And laſtly, for <hi>Deſcartes</hi> to give up that point, would not be conſtrued to retract; having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf declar'd,<note place="margin">Let. <hi>67.</hi> Tom. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> he could not demonſtrate, that Beaſts had not an apprehenſive Soul, no more than it could be demonſtrated unto him, they had.</p>
                  <p>After that, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> paſſed to another Point, which had ſome Connexion with the former; which was, <hi>The Eſſence of the Soul,</hi> made by <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to conſiſt in actual <hi>Thinking,</hi> as he makes the <hi>Eſſence of a Body</hi> to conſiſt in actual and determinate <hi>Extenſion.</hi> He tells them, That though he has many Scruples, as to his Method and Manner whereby he offers to demonſtrate the diſtinction of the Soul and Body, and that many People continued diſſatisfied a little with the Anſwers he gave to the Objections of <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus</hi> and <hi>M. Arnauld;</hi> notwithſtanding he would not diſpute him that Glory of having ſaid ſomething thereon, wholly New and very Ingenious. That he is likewiſe diſpoſed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Opinion touching the Eſſence of the Soul, provided he would ſatisfy him as to one Difficulty taken from Experience.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:46662:79"/>
                  <p>Many Perſons, ſaid he, have made you that Objection: That if the Eſſence of the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in actual Thought, it were impoſſible ſhe ſhould exiſt without thinking; and thus it would follow, we ſhould have Thought whilſt we were in our Mother's Belly. You will not ſcruple in the leaſt that Conſequence: And as to what's rejoyned by them, that had we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Thought, whilſt we were in that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, we muſt neceſſarily have remembred ſome one of thoſe Thoughts, at leaſt, that we had there: You anſwer, The reaſon of our Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembrance, is, becauſe the Memory conſiſts in certain Traces, which being made in the Brain, upon thinking of an Object, are there preſerv'd; and that the Brain of Infants is too moiſt and ſoft for the preſervation of thoſe Traces, at leaſt in ſuch a manner as is requiſite to cauſe remembrance.<note place="margin">Lettr. Tom. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> But you are preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Anſwer, for as much as in ſeveral places of your Writings, you diſtinguiſh Memory into two ſorts, whereof one depends upon the Body, and thoſe Tracks or Footſteps impreſſed upon the Brain; and the other, which is purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, depends upon the Soul above. You alſo diſtinguiſh Notices into two kinds: The one that depend upon the Organ, and the other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, that are wholly Independent on it. Now we can eaſily apprehend that the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Brain of an Infant, may be in the cauſe why the Soul recollects not thoſe Thoughts which have their dependence on it; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Memory wholly intellectual, thoſe pure Conceptions, thoſe immaterial Notices which are altogether independent on the Organ, and the different Plaits or Impreſſes of the

                        <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Let.</hi> 4.38.</note> But that is the thing I am asking a ſufficient Reaſon for, and of which I ſhould be highly pleas'd to be convinced. In effect <hi>Voetius</hi> had given expreſs Orders to both his <hi>Envoys,</hi> to ſee that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> gave a clear Explication of the Point.</p>
                  <p>From the Eſſence of the Soul they proceeded to the Eſſence of the Body. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> entred on that Article with an acknowledgment of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he formerly fell into, advertiſing at the ſame time <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to take care to avoid the like Misfortune. I believed, ſaid he, the World was from all Eternity, upon a falſe Principle I ſuffered my ſelf to pre-poſſeſſed with, to wit, That God was a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Being in his <hi>Actions,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> You have one alſo, of which the ſelf ſame Error is the neceſſary Conſequence: And I am not the firſt that has put you in mind of it. You not only affirm, That the Eſſence of Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Extenſion, but farther, That <hi>Matter, Extenſion</hi> and <hi>Space,</hi> are but three different Names of one and the ſame Thing: From whence, with you, it follows, That whereven we conceive Extenſion and Space, there muſt neceſſarily be Matter. And from thence you conclude, the World is boundleſs and infinite, or, as you chooſe to ſpeak, indefinite in Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Your Adverſaries of the Terreſtrial World have indeavoured to demonſtrate, That
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46662:80"/>bottoming on thoſe ſame Principles, the World and Matter muſt always have been, and that Matter muſt neceſſarily continue always. For as there is Matter at preſent, where we conceive at preſent Space and Extenſion, ſo by the ſame Reaſon there always has been, and ever will be, Matter, where we conceive there ever has been, and ever will be Space and Extenſion. But we conceive that there always has been, and that there always will be Space and Extenſion, where the World at preſent ſtands. This is a nice Point, and might juſtifie the Conduct of the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> on your Reſpect. Betwixt our ſelves <hi>(continu'd he)</hi> the reaſoning that bewildered you in that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable Maze is a meer Sophiſm. A <hi>real</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, ſay you, cannot comport with <hi>nothing.</hi> Now to be extended, is a <hi>real</hi> Attribute, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore agree with <hi>nothing.</hi> It agrees not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding with Space, and with what we imagine above the Firmament, and call by the Name of Space. Therefore that which is above the Firmament is real. Therefore that which is in the Indefinite above the Firmament, is Matter. Therefore Matter, Extenſion and Space, are the ſelf-ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>You ought to have apprehended the defect of that Reaſoning from two Reſpects. Firſt, from the Conſequence that is taken from thence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding for the Eternity of the World, and which voluntarily offers it ſelf to the Mind. Secondly, that ſuppoſing it falſe, as indeed it is, that the World ſhould be Eternal, they'l de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you by an Argument, exactly like yours, that another Attribute, no leſs real than that you term ſo, comports with nothing.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46662:81"/>For if the World is not Eternal, it is plain a Man may truly ſay, that <hi>nothing</hi> is Eternal; ſince, excepting God, there has <hi>Nothing</hi> been from all Eternity. Now to be Eternal, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, as real an Attribute as to be extended. But as it is a manifeſt Abſurdity to affirm, a real Attribute can accord with <hi>nothing,</hi> it is neceſſary to reconcile it all, that you agree with your Adverſaries, that thoſe Words, <hi>Extended</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> when attributed to <hi>Nothing</hi> and to <hi>Space,</hi> make in our Minds quite contrary Ideas, to what we have upon our attributing them to a <hi>Being</hi> or a <hi>Body.</hi> When we attribute them to a Being or a Body, they ſignifie ſomething <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> when we attribute them to Nothing and to Space, they give a <hi>Negative</hi> ſignification. In a Word, when 'tis ſaid, nothing is Eternal, no more is meant, than that there has been no Being created from all Eternity. And when 'tis ſaid, There is only an extended Space beyond the Firmament, it is underſtood there is no Body there, and that there may be one to fill up that Void, and nothing of a Body, which we there conceive. We cannot ſpeak of <hi>Nothing</hi> and of Space, but we muſt ſpeak <hi>Something</hi> of them. We cannot expreſs what we think of them, but by the Terms in uſe: Thoſe Terms are the ſame we imploy to ſpeak of Beings: But if we make Reflection on the Ideas, we ſhall ſee they are wholly different, nor are they ruin'd and deſtroy'd by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is pretended.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in Mind of a little Inſtance, ſubtil enough upon this Subject, which formerly Dr. <hi>More,</hi> an Engliſh Gentleman, gave you,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46662:81"/>he whoſe Elogies went ſo far as to apply to you what <hi>Horace</hi> ſaid of <hi>Homer; Qui nil molitur inepte.</hi> He propos'd this Queſtion to you. Suppoſe that God ſhould deſtroy the World, and reproduce it a little after, might not it be ſaid there would be, or at leaſt, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there would be ſome Interval between the Deſtruction and Reproduction of the World, although nothing of real interceeded betwixt them both? From whence he proceeded to conclude, That ſuppoſing in a Chamber God ſhould annihilate all the Bodies that are between the Walls, there would yet be Length, Breadth and Depth, although at the ſame time there was nothing real there. He thought to have foil'd you, ſuppoſing you would readily have aſſented to his firſt Propoſition, of which there ſeem'd no Doubt or Scruple: But I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he found himſelf well enough Match'd, when you deny'd him that we could conceive in his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> any Duration or Interval, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deſtruction and new Production of the World.</p>
                  <p>The Author of a Letter wrote ſome years ago to a <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſopher, afforded the Reader Sport and Diverſion enough upon that Point, by ſeveral very pretty <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which he offers. But as I am not given to Trifles, and 'tis unbefitting a Philoſopher of my Character to be merry, I ſhall only make uſe of your own Principles. I'll take that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Air in a Chamber to be deſtroy'd by God, without any admittance or production of another Body there. That <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, makes it manifeſt, That Extenſion may be conceiv'd without a Body, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46662:82"/>that the Eſſence of Matter conſiſts not in Extenſion. You will not admit of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis: But I am going to ſhew, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no Contradiction, by a reaſoning much like one of thoſe you make uſe of in another Caſe, and take for Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>For according to you, ſeeing I diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thing that thinks, not conceiving Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and becauſe I diſtinctly conceive Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not concerning a thing that thinks; I have good Grounds for my Concluſion, that a thing which thinks is diſtinguiſh'd from Extenſion, and that Extenſion is diſtinguiſh'd from a thing that thinks. Thus it is you demonſtrate the diſtinction of the Body and Soul, and thus it is evident, one may exiſt without the other, with a Contradiction; and that from this grand <hi>Maxim,</hi> That the difference of Ideas is the only means we have of knowing the real diſtinction of Things, and their Independence upon one another. Upon that Principle thus I argue. I moſt diſtinctly conceive the Deſtruction or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of a Body, without conceiving the production of another Body. Therefore it is no Contradiction a Body ſhould be deſtroy'd without another Body's Production. Therefore it is no Contradiction the Air betwixt the four Walls of a Chamber ſhould be deſtroy'd, and yet no other Body produc'd in its room.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, which turns to the ſame Account. I moſt diſtinctly conceive a part of Matter, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide all others, and I moſt diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all other without that, for Inſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conceiving the Air inclos'd in a Chamber. My <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> then is eſtabliſh'd, as well as the Conſequences that naturally follow, againſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46662:82"/>your Opinion, touching the Eſſence of Matter. So that if you have any Inclination towards a Peace, you will be content to ſay, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Things in their natural Capacity, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is neceſſarily extended; but will willingly give up that Expreſſion that hath diſguſted all the World: That Extenſion, Matter and Space, were all the very ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>That Inſult which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made upon <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> in bandying one part of his Principles againſt another, worſted my <hi>old Gentleman's</hi> Patience, and rattled him ſo, that 'was ten to one but he had tore the Paper on the ſpot. He propos'd our going off without acquainting <hi>Ariſtotle's Embaſſadors,</hi> who were ſtragled a good way from us, telling us, the Company of ſuch ſort of Cattle was not very pleaſing: But we repreſented to him how diſhonourable a thing, and unbecoming of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> that would be. That that Paper was not ſo much a Project of Peace, as a Challenge and Defiance, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had ſent him; that probably he might ſlight it, and probably he might think it worth while to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it: That <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had ſo wonderful a Gift of perſuading and captivating Spirits, and the production of a World was a thing of that ſurprizing Nature, that doubtleſs the two Souls that bore us Company, muſt be converted to <hi>Carteſianiſm,</hi> provided <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> would be at the pains of explaining his <hi>System</hi> to them in a plauſible and familiar manner. Theſe Reaſons ſetled him again, and we purſued in the reading of the Paper, in expectation of the two Souls.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:46662:83"/>
                  <p>From the Eſſence of the Body and Soul, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> paſſed on to their Union, and the Relations they have betwixt themſelves. He began with great Encomiums on <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> for having opened the Eyes of the Philoſophers, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the Unuſefulneſs as well as Abſurdity of their Intentional Species, in many caſes, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,</hi> That he had taught nothing on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that ought to be held ſo ſtrange and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible by the Peripateticks, had not they deſerted the Sentiments of their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Maſter, to follow the Whimſies and Imaginations of his Commentators. That he himſelf had remarked in many Places, That the Senſe of Feeling was diſperſed throughout the Body, and through all the Organs of the other Senſes: That Viſion, Taſte, the Perception of Sounds and Smells were only cauſed by the local Motion of ſome Bodies, that touch'd and moved the Organs of the different Senſes; that in effect, if that Motion were inſufficient for the Soul's perceiving Objects, thoſe intentional Species ſubſtituted in their Place, would be as far from ſerving Turn. That he was not for rejecting <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Doctrin concerning the Seat of the Soul in the Pineal Gland, were it propoſed only as a pure <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſince all that others ſay amounts to nothing better; but it was inſufferable that Syſtem ſhould be urged as a ſetled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated Truth. And that the Reſpect <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſtill pretended for Truth and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought to make him qualify and moderate his Aſſertions thereupon.</p>
                  <p>He intreated him likewiſe to be more Human and good-natured towards thoſe who taught the Soul was expanded through the Body; and this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46662:83"/>is what he added to ſhew the <hi>Carteſians</hi> were a little Unreaſonable in that Affair: For, ſaid he, when you aſſert the Soul is placed in the <hi>Pineal Gland,</hi> either you ſuppoſe ſhe takes up all the extent of that Gland, or that ſhe only poſſeſſes one indiviſible part of it; if ſhe poſſeſſes all the Capacity of the Gland, ſhe herſelf muſt thence be extended; for that Conſequence entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles yours, which you draw againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who make the Soul expanded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body. If ſhe only poſſeſſes an indiviſible Part thereof, there muſt neceſſarily be ſome part of Matter that is indiviſible, and not extended: And thus in admiting that disjunctive Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you appropriate to the Soul, what you affirm belongs to Matter only, otherwiſe you grant an Attribute to Matter, which on all other occaſions you deny, and pretend according to your Principles, however we underſtand it, that it is the only peculiar of a Spiritual Soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all the Nerves, where are the Radiations of the Spirits, that enter in and out of the <hi>Pineal Gland,</hi> can neither part from the ſame indiviſible Point of the Gland, nor meet there; ſo that if the Soul was in an indiviſible Point of that Gland, ſhe could not have the Perception of all Objects there. But if you reply, The Soul is not in the Gland as a Body is in another Body, or as a Body is in a Place, but that the Soul in quality of a Spirit is not in that <hi>Gland,</hi> but becauſe ſhe acts there, becauſe ſhe thinks there, wills there and perceives Objects there; and that, ſince the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Impreſſions of Objects terminate in divers Points of the <hi>Gland,</hi> where ſhe is advertiſed of them, it may be ſaid, the Soul is in all the Gland: The Philoſophers that undertake you,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46662:84"/>are ready to take you up with a freſh Objection: For if the Soul acts, wills, thinks, apprehends Objects in all the Gland, that is to ſay, in a very deviſible Space; and if that be ſufficient to affirm ſhe is in all the Pineal Gland, it will be true, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to ſay, The Soul is in all the Body, ſince it acts and perceives Objects in all the Body; ſhe ſees them in the Eye, as you ſay, ſhe perceives them in that part of the Pineal Gland, where the Optick Nerve doth point, or the Rays of the Spirits that proceed from that Nerve; ſhe perceives Sounds in the Ear, or as you ſay, ſhe perceives them in another Point of the Pineal Gland, where the Nerves do center, or the Rays that ſerve for that Perception.</p>
                  <p>Thus that pretended Bug-bear of Philoſophy, I mean the Preſence of the Soul throughout the Body, that cauſes her to feel in the Hand, when that is prick'd, and makes her move it preſently, and withdraw it, upon the Senſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, that makes her ſtir the Foot in order to advance, methinks is no longer monſtrous or frightful, nor a Prejudice of Infancy evidently falſe, ſeeing that Preſence of the Soul through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body is no other than that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her in the Pineal Gland, the Pineal Gland being extended as well as the whole Body; for the Diminutivenſs of the Extenſion makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Purpoſe: Why therefore ſhould that Vertual Extenſion of a Spirit be turned to a Jeſt and Ridicule, when 'tis the ſame as is admitted by the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> when both are well explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and undoubtedly all the Senſations may very near be as juſtly explained upon this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> as upon that of the Pineal Gland.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46662:84"/>
                  <p>From all which <hi>Aristotle</hi> concluded, That <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had better acknowledg with the wiſeſt and leaſt conceited of the Philoſophers, that the Relation the Soul had with the Body in the Perception of Objects, was an incomprehenſible Myſtery to the Mind of Man: That the manner of Objects acting on the Senſes, as alſo how their Action was carried to the Brain, might be very well explained, but that a Bar was put to all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progreſs, unleſs a Man would run himſelf into an unintelligible Jargon, or advance Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions dangerous in themſelves, or in the Concluſions that might be deduced from them.</p>
                  <p>He went on in commending <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> for his Integrity,<note place="margin">Lett. de Deſc. Tom. <hi>1.</hi> Lett. <hi>69.</hi>
                     </note> manifeſted in his declaring there was nothing in the Idea of a Soul, or a Spirit, that included an Impoſſibility of the Production of Motion by them; and at once he blamed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs of the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> who fool-hardily advanced, That no Creature whatſoever had the Power of producing Motion. It is true, adjoyned he, with a little daſh of Malice, that Paradox, as ill founded as it is, is one of the Principal Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the <hi>Carteſian System:</hi> For without it how ſhould an equal Quantity of Motion be kept up in the World, where there are ſo many Souls, ſo many Angels, and ſo many Devils, whoſe greateſt Paſtime it is to produce and create Hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burlies every Moment? But <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> is ſo much more Praiſe-worthy for preferring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Truth</hi> before thoſe of his own <hi>Syſtem,</hi> as dear and beloved as it was.</p>
                  <p>The next Article was upon that grand Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox of <hi>M. Deſcartes;</hi>

                     </note> That the Eſſences of Things and Truths commonly called neceſſary,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46662:85"/>are not independent of God, and that they are only eternal and immutable, becauſe God hath will'd it ſo: That God is the total and efficient Cauſe of the Truth of Propoſitions: That it was equally arbitrary for God to cauſe that it ſhould be falſe, that all the Lines drawn from the center to the Circumference ſhould be equal, as to create the World: See then the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſpoke at length upon that Subject.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, He did not well underſtand what was the Senſe and Meaning of thoſe Words, <hi>God is the efficient and total Cauſe of the Truth of Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> For the Truth of a Propoſition, ſince it is not a Being, but a meer Relation of Conformity that it hath with its Object, could not, to ſpeak properly, have an efficient Cauſe; and if in ſome Senſe it might be ſaid to have an efficient Cauſe, that could be nothing but the Mind or Tongue of him that Frames and Pronounces the Propoſition. Again, he demanded if <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> ſpoke in general of all Neceſſary Truths, or only of ſome Particulars. He could not <hi>(continued he)</hi> ſpeak of all: For doubtleſs he did not believe that God was, or had been able to make theſe Propoſitions falſe, <hi>There is a God; God is the free Cauſe of all Beings; God is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Being.</hi> He muſt therefore only ſpeak of Propoſitions relating to the Creatures, becauſe according as he expreſſes himſelf in one of his Letters,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> God is the Author of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as well as the Exiſtence of the Creatures: But that he had made a Reflection, That the Truths which reſpect the Eſſence of the Creatures have a neceſſary Connexion with thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Eſſence of God; and that if it was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46662:85"/>poſſible for the one to be falſe, the other might be ſo too: As, for example, this, <hi>The Creature eſſentially depends on God,</hi> is a Propoſition belonging to the Eſſence of the Creature, which if it could be falſe, that other would fall into the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. <hi>God is the abſolute Master and free Cauſe of all Beings;</hi> for neither the one could be true without the other's being ſo, nor could the one be falſe unleſs the other was likewiſe falſe: Whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adviſed <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to have a ſpecial Care, leſt the profound Reſpect he affected towards the Omnipotence of God, ſhould not only degenerate into Superſtition, but ſhould proceed ſo far as to bring him to Blaſphemous Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made a frank and honeſt Acknowledgment, That <hi>Deſcartes</hi> had explain'd the Nature of moſt ſenſible Qualities in a ſiner and exacter way than he had done: As of the Hardneſs of Bodies, of Liquidity, of the Power of the <hi>Elaverium,</hi> of Cold, of Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to manifeſt he had no other Concern than for the Intereſts of Truth, he retracted, without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony his Poſition of the Eternity of the World, and <hi>his Sphere of Fire.</hi> But ſince that Sphere of Fire makes one of the principal Parts of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi> Syſtem, and is one of the chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his World, he preſumed that <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> could do no leſs than abandon all his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes</hi> in Exchange, againſt which he urged many Reaſons: But <hi>Voetius</hi> having underſtood from us that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was ready to put his World in Execution, and the Deſign of our Journey was, that we might be Witneſſes of that mighty Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he wrote a Poſtſcript in the Margent, in which he promis'd to ſubmit himſelf to that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46662:86"/>Experience; and ſuppoſing it ſhould anſwer the Pretenſions of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> his <hi>Vortexes</hi> ſhould be received, at leaſt as a good <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> for the explaining the Phenomena of the World, which God hath made. But he farther adjoyned, That in caſe <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſhould fail in his Attempt, he ſhould be oblig'd thus far to condeſcend, That his Phyſicks, which turn for the moſt part upon thoſe Hinges, is an Edifice without Foundation: And that he ſhould reſt contented with the Praiſe common to all the Leaders of a Sect, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Philoſophy had ſomething that was Good and True in it, and that he ſhould avow with the reſt of Mankind, that to <hi>build a World,</hi> and eſtabliſh a Syſtem of Philoſophy, true in all its Principles and Concluſions, was a Point the Mind of Man in its utmoſt Endeavours could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Demonſtrations touching the Exiſtence of God, the Rules of Motion, and ſome other Opinions, for which that Philoſopher had engag'd a greater Zeal and Earneſtneſs, and which required a more through Diſcuſſion: <hi>Aristotle</hi> propoſed to him the pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome Neutral and Unprejudic'd Place, where they might confer together before diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Arbitratours, to whoſe Determinations they ſhould ſubmit themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He concluded with a gracious Offer of aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating him in the <hi>Empire of Philoſophy,</hi> upon thoſe only Conditions compriz'd in that Project. He admoniſh'd him to ſix ſome Bounds to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſuring him of the Vanity of his Hopes if he purſu'd to carry them any farther; for that his own <hi>Authority</hi> was too well eſtabliſh'd throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> to be indangered by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46662:86"/>the Enterprizes of a new Comer: That almoſt all Univerſities and Colleges had renew'd the Oath of Allegiance to him, and had made an Offenſive and Defenſive League againſt the New Philoſophy: That ſome Ladies and fine Wits of the great World, that ſeem'd to ſet up for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and Protectors of a new Party in <hi>France,</hi> were not ſuch as much ſtreſs might be laid upon: That a Philoſophical Dreſs of Mind would be as changeable among the <hi>French Ladies,</hi> as the other Modes and Faſhions for the Body: That few were to be found already that valu'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereupon: And that 'twas ſaid, ſince the Play of one <hi>Moliere,</hi> the Name of a <hi>Learn'd Woman</hi> was become a kind of an Affront. That though ſeveral Learn'd Men, and many Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians were taken formerly with the new Ideas, there were a very few at preſent, that car'd for the Name of <hi>Carteſians:</hi> Some having preſently deſerted, to take the part of the <hi>Gaſſendiſts:</hi> Others having cut out Syſtems for themſelves, compos'd of what they thought beſt in both the ancient and new Philoſophers: And almoſt all affecting to be <hi>Originals</hi> without tying themſelves to any Seat Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern whatſoever. An effect of more pernicious Conſequence than is imagined, of an ill Example which has been given, by the new Schiſm made in Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>Scarce had we made an end of reading our Paper, when the two <hi>Paripateticks</hi> re entred in <hi>Merſennus,</hi> and told us, That from the Weſtern Coaſt they deſcry'd ſomething as an Opaque Body, that they knew not what to make of, ſailing through the Air with wonderful Speed. I'll venture my Life on't, ſays our <hi>old Gentleman,</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:46662:87"/>it is ſome incruſted Star, that tumbles from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> after having loſt its own; and is become a Comet. We made towards it with all haſt, and the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Conjecture of the good old Man gave us good Diverſion, when a few Moments after we perceiv'd it was nothing but a Man mounted on an extreamly black and condens'd Cloud, whoſe whole Accoutrement look'd exactly like that of a <hi>Magician,</hi> that was either going to or coming from the <hi>Devil's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> In effect, <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> who knew him, inform'd us that he was a <hi>Chineſe Mandarin,</hi> the Preſident of the Magicians of his Country, whom he had often met in our <hi>Vortex,</hi> and about a year ago, had had a Conference with him upon the Exiſtence of a God, and that he had prov'd it to him by the Demonſtrations of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> that as reſolv'd and caſe-harden'd an Atheiſt as he found him, his Demonſtrations had ſtock'd him ſo as he had promiſed to examine them at his leiſure. He mov'd us to proceed to meet him to learn what was the Succeſs of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and whether the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was converted. So we advanc'd towards him; but only <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> put on a viſible Countenance. They ſaluted each other, and after ſome Complements paſs'd, <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> demanded, Whether he ſtill doubted of the Exiſtence of a God? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he was throughly convinc'd; and that he own'd himſelf under a great Obligation to him, for having put him upon the Examination of a Point, of which he was aſham'd to have ſo much as doubted, for want of making ſome Reflections, with which a moſt ordinary capacity might have furniſh'd him. God be prais'd (<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd Father</hi> Merſennus) what Joy is here
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46662:87"/>for <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> when we ſhall certify him that his Philoſophy has convey'd the Knowledg of God to the ends of the Earth! It was certainly with very good Reaſon he wrote to me upon a time, that he was undetermin'd whether he ſhould publiſh his Works of Philoſophy,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Let. <hi>37.</hi>
                     </note> but that he thought himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience, not to deprive the <hi>Publick</hi> of five or ſix Sheets, that contain'd the Demonſtrations of the Exiſtence of a God.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>(reply'd the Mandarin)</hi> I would not adviſe you to communicate to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> the Succeſs his Demonſtrations had in <hi>China.</hi> They paſs'd there for pure <hi>Paralogiſms,</hi> at leaſt two of them that are moſt in his Eſteem, and that are drawn from the Idea of a God, and a Being abſolutely Perfect. And my Obligation to you conſiſts not in your having communicated to me thoſe Demonſtrations, but in that having communicated them, in order to my examining them, it took me in the Head, after having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd their weakneſs, to diſcuſs ſome other which that Philoſopher makes light of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of his own, and which yet are thoſe, I owe my Conviction to. A certain <hi>European Doctor,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> whoſe Sums the Jeſuits have tranſlated into <hi>Chineſe,</hi> which I conſulted upon that occaſion, and the explication made me by the <hi>Mandarin Verbieſt,</hi> who arriv'd in <hi>China</hi> out of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſome years ſince, have made a hundred times more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my Mind, than all the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Viſions that ſeem'd extreamly ſhallow.</p>
                  <p>That Anſwer Thunder-ſtruck the poor <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> who demanded haſtily of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darin</hi> what fault he found with <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46662:88"/>Demonſtrations? He ſet himſelf preſently to refute them, in ſo much, that we had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing their Civilities and Complements chang'd into a real Diſpute.</p>
                  <p>To let you ſee, <hi>ſaid the Mandarin,</hi> that it is not on a groundleſs Suppoſition, I condemn your Demonſtrations for Paralogiſms, you muſt know that after I had heard them from you, I fortun'd to find them in the Hands of a young <hi>Hollander</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> who was upon a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with his Country-Merchants, your <hi>Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s Meditations. Seeing I was already in part acquainted with their Contents, and wiſh'd to be more ſatisfactorily inſtructed, he made me a Preſent of them, and there I read afreſh all thoſe Demonſtrations, all the Objections made him thereupon, and all the Anſwers he returns. The firſt Reflection that I made in general upon my Reading, was, that thoſe Demonſtrations and Anſwers given to the contrary Objections, left me wholly, at leaſt very much, in doubt, and my Mind fluctuating in as great uncertainty as before, concerning the Point that was in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and that though I did not ſee forthwith the Faults of them, yet methoughts I ſaw them. Upon that I preſented them to two of my Friends, of the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of able Men, that are accuſtom'd to a <hi>Geometrical</hi> Method, eſpecially ſince the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Mathematicians arriv'd in <hi>China.</hi> After they had run them over, one of the two aſſur'd me, without deciding any thing, that if thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations were true Demonſtrations, they were admirable, ſince they were extreamly plain and ſimple: The other adjoyn'd, that that Simplicity it ſelf rendred them ſuſpicious,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46662:88"/>for as much as, ſaid he, the more ſimple they are, the more they ought to have of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effect of Demonſtration, on the Minds of thoſe they are propos'd to. Now I am inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that Effect: My Mind finds not the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ſtrong as to be carry'd away with it: On the contrary, I perceive, I know not what Doubts and Scruples, that ſtand in the way of my Aſſent, and that induce it to believe thoſe Reaſonings are falſe. And I remark, added he, that all, as well Friends as Enemies, of that Philoſopher, that have wrote their Opinion of his Demonſtrations, have made the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and Experimented the ſame thing, as I my ſelf. We ſet our ſelves therefore to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examination of them, and began with that which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> propoſes firſt of all in the Geometrical Abridgment of his Meditation.</p>
                  <p>An Attribute which we ſee diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Idea of a thing may be truly affirm'd of that thing. But in the Idea of God, that is to ſay, in the Idea of a Being abſolutely perfect, I diſtinctly perceive neceſſary Exiſtence is contain'd; ſince neceſſary Exiſtence is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and a Being infinitely perfect, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all ſorts of Perfections. Therefore I can affirm Exiſtence of a Being abſolutely perfect, and ſay with Truth and the greateſt Aſſurance, that God exiſts.</p>
                  <p>Upon a ſecond reading of that <hi>Demonſtration</hi> and Examination of each particular Propoſition of it, whatever appearance of Truth they ſeem'd to carry with them, all our Scruples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow in us afreſh. We apply'd our ſelves to the finding out the Cauſe: We examin'd our ſelves, according to the Council of the <hi>Author</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:46662:89"/>of the <hi>Demonſtration:</hi> And we deſcended into our own Breaſt, to ſee if we had not hoarded up ſome Prejudices that might block out thoſe Propoſitions, whoſe Evidence, we thought, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd admittance. We found none at all there, having been to that Inſtant very indifferent as to the truth of that Concluſion; and ſuppoſing the Ballance was not in an exact Equilibrium, we certainly inclin'd towards the ſide of the Exiſtence of a God, rather than the other. So that the Prejudice which favoured that Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was more to be fear'd on our Account, than on the contrary. Moreover we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to our ſelves, we were not concern'd at the reputation of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> and that we were untouch'd with Envy, with which he ſeems to ſuſpect ſome of his Country-Men tainted, who had declar'd againſt his Demonſtrations. That incourag'd us to believe, our Scruples proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Demonſtration it ſelf, which by Conſequence, muſt only carry a ſeeming Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſince a real and true Evidence of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration or a Propoſition, is neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſatisfaction and tranquillity of Mind, that perceives it ſelf enlightned in ſo lively a manner, as makes it impoſſible to doubt or withſtand the Truth. Hence it is that maugre the Wranglings of thoſe <hi>Deſcartes</hi> calls <hi>Septicks,</hi> it is impoſſible to have any Scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>firſt Principles,</hi> any ways to doubt, if the Whole be bigger than its Part; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is impoſſible that the ſame Thing ſhould be, and not be at the ſame time. Reflecting therefore upon that Argumentation, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it muſt needs ſeem evident, and at the ſame time we experienc'd from within our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46662:89"/>ſelves, that nothing was leſs really ſo. All the Difficulty was to diſcover the Spring of that falſe Light, and to find out what it was that dazled, inſtead of cleaning our Perſpectives. We preſum'd we might be underſtood, and our meaning thereupon be clearly explain'd by theſe Reflections.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Axiom</hi> that makes the firſt Propoſition in <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Reaſoning, is true but upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of two Things. Firſt, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of which he ſpeaks be a real one, that is, ſuch a one as repreſents a real, at leaſt a poſſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Secondly, that the Mind, which forms that Idea, be clearly convinc'd that it is real. Thus becauſe the Idea of a right-lin'd Triangle is real, and a Geometrician acknowledges it as ſuch, perceiving diſtinctly the equality of the three Angles with two Rights, upon that Idea he may truly affirm of that Triangle, that it has three Angles equal to two Rights.</p>
                  <p>But if the Idea is not real, or if I am not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſured it is ſo, it is falſe that I can affirm a real Attribute of it, which I diſtinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in it. Take for Inſtance, that imaginary Idea of <hi>A Mountain without a Valley,</hi> in as much as it repreſents a Mountain to me, I have an Idea of an Height; yet I can truly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that a Mountain without a Valley is high.</p>
                  <p>If the Idea is real, and yet is not evident to me that it is ſo, it is true that the Attribute I diſtinctly apprehend in it, agrees to the thing it repreſents: But it is falſe that I can affirm that Attribute of the thing in Hand, or that I can demonſtrate to my ſelf that property from that Idea. As ſuppoſing this Idea was a real one.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46662:90"/>
                     <hi>A Horſe that has Perception and Senſe: Deſcartes</hi> that thought it was not real, could not conclude from thence, That an Horſe was capable of Pain and Pleaſure; although that property is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly contain'd in the Idea of a Being furniſh'd with Senſe and Apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>That once ſuppos'd to the end, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Exiſtence of God, by that ſole Idea <hi>(A Being abſolutely perfect)</hi> it is not only requiſite it ſhould be a real Idea, as it certainly is, but that it be evident to me, abſtractedly from all the uſual Demonſtrations, that that Idea is a real one, that is, that it repreſents to me a real Object, at leaſt a poſſible one, and no <hi>Chimera.</hi> Now I maintain, before <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> that Idea is not evidently real, before the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Demonſtrations: For if it be evidently real, it is either ſo of its ſelf, or from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition I make of the Ideas it is compos'd of. It is not ſo of it ſelf: For if that Idea were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt of it ſelf, our Mind could never make a Problem of it, nor demand ſeriouſly of it ſelf before the Demonſtration; Is a Being infinitely perfect, a real Being, or an Imaginary one? No more than it could make a Queſtion of theſe, Is the Whole bigger than its Part? Can a Thing be and not be at the ſame time? Since they are manifeſtly real of themſelves. But our Mind before Demonſtration, can make it ſelf this Demand, whether a Being abſolutely perfect, is really a Being, or in Phancy only? And a Man that never had reflected on the things that prove the Exiſtence of a God, would not be in the leaſt ſurpriz'd, to hear that Queſtion ſeriouſly propos'd, as he would be, ſhould any one ask, as if he were in Doubt, whether the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46662:90"/>Whole is bigger than its Part. That Idea then is not manifeſtly real of it ſelf. It remains then that the Evidence of its reality muſt be fetch'd from the Examination that we make thereon. If ſo, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ought to have minded us of that Precaution, before we entred on his <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But I prove that antecedently to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, the reality of that Idea can neither be evident to us of it ſelf, nor by the diſcuſſion of the Terms contain'd in't. Firſt, becauſe the Attribute is not comprehended in the Idea of the Subject: Since it is not eſſential to a <hi>Being</hi> to be abſolutely perfect. Secondly, becauſe that Diſcuſſion affords me many ſeeming Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which my Mind knows not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile before the ordinary Demonſtrations. For to examine and unravel that Idea, which of its ſelf is very general and confus'd, is to retail all Perfections, whereof not one muſt be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Being</hi> abſolutely perfect. Now among thoſe Perfections, there are ſome that blunt and repulſe the Mind, becauſe ſhe has not ſo great a reach as to conceive them. For Inſtance, that that <hi>Being</hi> ſhould be of it ſelf, that that Being ſhould be Almighty and Independent of every thing in its acting, even to the Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Beings</hi> out of <hi>Nothing.</hi> There are others that ſeem to her inconſiſtent in the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For inſtance, ſhe conceives Liberty and Immutability, Immenſity and Indiviſibility, the Properties of Bodies and of Spirits, as ſo many Perfections. She ſees that the Perfections which agree to ſeveral Beings ſeparately, muſt all be united in that abſolutely perfect Being. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving therefore a Being abſolutely perfect, ſhe repreſents it at once as a free Being, and an
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46662:91"/>Immutable, as one that can deſire and be averſe to the ſame thing, though its Will be always Unchangeable, that is, Omnipreſent, without being extended or diviſible, that is, a pure <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and at the ſame time includes all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of <hi>Bodies</hi> poſſible to be produc'd.</p>
                  <p>Nay I dare preſume to ſay, that this Idea thus analyz'd, in reſpect of a Mind, that never made any Reflection on the Reaſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Exiſtence of a neceſſary Being, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ſo many Contradictions in that neceſſary Being, would as ſoon repreſent it as an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Being, as a real one, and that, not ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe uſual Reaſons, that prove to us a firſt cauſe of all Beings, and the Reflections that follow them, we ſhould as eaſily regard that Being as impoſſible as poſſible. From whence I at leaſt conclude, that the <hi>Idea of a Being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect,</hi> cannot be look'd on as an Idea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly real, by him that examins it, before his Acquaintance with the ordinary Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Conſequently, that he that examins it cannot abſolutely attribute Exiſtence to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which is the ſame thing, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to himſelf the Exiſtence of a God, from the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect.</p>
                  <p>The defect therefore of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Paralogiſm,</hi> conſiſts in this, that he ſuppoſes, before any Demonſtrations, the Idea of a Being abſolutely perfect, to be taken by the Mind for real, and as having a real Object, which is palpably falſe.</p>
                  <p>All this diſcovers the Original of the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples all the World have had, as to that Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and which thoſe themſelves have not been clear of, whom the difficulty of reſolving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46662:91"/>ſo ſubtil a <hi>Paralogiſm</hi> hath drawn over to <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s Party, who doubtleſs had they been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſincere, muſt have confeſs'd they ſtill felt ſome diſquiet in their Mind on that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and that it was by meer Violence they had at laſt accuſtom'd their Underſtanding to tell them, that Demonſtration was evident. This was the Fault which ſome felt, rather than ſaw, that made them deny Exiſtence to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd in the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect. For abſolutely ſpeaking, although it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in the Catalogue of Perfections, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to that Being, yet the Mind to which the Idea was not manifeſtly real, took it not in, and excluded it, in making that very Problem, <hi>Does a Being abſolutely perfect Exiſt?</hi> Until the Arguments independent of that Idea had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd the Problem, and convinc'd it that ſuch a Being did Exiſt.</p>
                  <p>And let not <hi>Deſcartes</hi> ſay, that that <hi>Idea</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding nothing but <hi>Perfections,</hi> it is evident it includes nothing but what is <hi>Real;</hi> for a <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Idea</hi> may be compos'd of only <hi>Real Ideas;</hi> here then is one exactly like that we are in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of, <hi>A Triangle that hath all the Perfections of Triangles.</hi> That Idea, though it includes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides real Perfections, is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Chimera,</hi> ſince for Inſtance a <hi>rectangled Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle</hi> has oppoſite Properties to thoſe of an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,</hi> and that Oppoſition is the reaſon they are inconſiſtent with one another. So, though all the Perfections of Beings are real, it does not follow that that Idea, <hi>A Being that hath all the Perfections of Beings,</hi> ſhould be a real Idea; and the Oppoſition I obſerve betwixt ſome of thoſe Perfections, naturally influences my Mind,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46662:92"/>unleſs prevented by the ordinary Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to doubt, at leaſt, whether that Idea is not a Chimera, as well as the other I have been ſpeaking of. From hence it is that in purſuance to the Demonſtrations that convince me of the Exiſtence of that Being, but that give me no clear and diſtinct Knowledg of its Eſſence, I confine my ſelf to ſay, That Being muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Perfections of all other Beings emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, that is to ſay, in a way I don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and which would never have come into my Head, or at leaſt would never have been look'd on by me as certainly and evidently poſſible, unleſs I had been convinc'd of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the firſt Being, before the diſcuſſion of its Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>That Solution of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s firſt Paralogiſm, made way to the diſcovery of that other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of his, where he concludes the Exiſtence of God from the <hi>objective reality of the Idea</hi> (as he ſpeaks) which we have of God. That Idea, (ſays he) which I find in my Mind, has an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite objective reality, ſince it repreſents to me an infinite Being. Therefore it has that infinite Being for its cauſe; therefore an infinite Being exiſts: For otherwiſe the Effect would have Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that were not in its cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have undertook that arguing, give us to underſtand, they have found it to be a greater Paralogiſm than the former, and bring many Reaſons for it, which <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> refutes as well as he is able: For my own Part, my Opinion is, That <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſuppoſes in that Reaſoning, what lay on him to be proved: For he not only ſuppoſes that that Idea has an objective reality, but farther, that I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46662:92"/>can be aſcertained independently of the common Demonſtrations, that it effectively has an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Reality, or that it has a Real and not an imaginary Object: But I am incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether its Object be real or imaginary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Demonſtrations, as I have already proved: And if I can doubt whether that Object is not a <hi>Chimera,</hi> I cannot ſuppoſe it has an <hi>Objective Reality,</hi> but ought to fear it has an <hi>Objective Vanity,</hi> if I may be allowed ſo to ſpeak; and in that Caſe I can by no means conclude, That God has impreſſed it on my Mind, and conſequently that there is a God: But I ought to think, That probably it proceeds from <hi>nothing,</hi> as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> expreſſes himſelf, That is, from an Imperfection of Mind that hath produced it, as it could produce this ſame a <hi>Mountain without a Valley.</hi> Hence it is clear and manifeſt, that thoſe two pretended Demonſtrations are meer Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms, and that both are maimed and lame in the ſame part, and defective on the ſame account.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> can never demonſtrate to me the Truth of the Propoſition, on which all his reaſoning depends; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cauſe of an Idea ought to contain formally or eminently all the Perfections which the <hi>Idea</hi> repreſents; for when 'tis ſaid, The Cauſe contains all the Perfections of the effect, that is not meant, nor is it evidently true, but of ſuch Perfections as the effect poſſeſſes, and not of thoſe it only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; for the Perfections the <hi>Idea</hi> repreſents, are not the Perfections of the <hi>Idea,</hi> the only Perfection of the <hi>Idea</hi> being to repreſent all thoſe Perfections: A Quality that hath nothing of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46662:93"/>Infinite in it, and conſequently ſuppoſes not an infinite Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay that Quality includes nothing of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe the Perfection of an Idea is not meaſured by the Dignity of the Object that it repreſents, but by the manner wherewith it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it; which being moſt imperfect in the Caſe before us, cannot be infinite. And this ſingle Inſtance which I ſubjoyn to all that <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Adverſaries have ſaid upon the Matter, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſhew, That the Propoſition on which is grounded his whoſe Reaſoning, will not paſs for a Principle of a Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, continued the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> Suppoſing the Reaſonings of that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> were not falſe or <hi>ſophiſtical,</hi> they would ſcarce merit the Name of <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> in the Subject they proceed upon: There never can be Demonſtrations of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a God, whilſt they are not received as ſuch, that is, whilſt they are not received as convincing Arguments beyond reply, the Truth of which is ſo prevalent as to deſtroy all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Prejudice. Now <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>clouded</hi> Minds can never be pierc'd by that <hi>Metaphyſical Subtilty:</hi> Thoſe of a <hi>middle Rank</hi> find themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, whether by their Prejudices, or for want of Penetration; moſt of thoſe of the <hi>firſt</hi> and moſt <hi>exalted</hi> Order, diſcover in them, or think they do diſcover very knotty Difficulties. All this put together makes one general Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice on their Conſideration, that never read them, and which might warrant their Prudence to conclude, if there were no other Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Exiſtence of God, there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly noneat all. So that my Advice to your
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46662:93"/>
                     <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and his Followers is, Not ſo highly to prefer his <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> before thoſe <hi>commonly</hi> made uſe of: For if it be true that all others are inevident in compariſon of theſe, very miſchievus Conſequences might be drawn from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, againſt the Exiſtence of a Firſt Being, of which the <hi>Libertines</hi> (if I may judge by thoſe of the <hi>Empire of China</hi>) would not fail to make advantage</p>
                  <p>Whether the Spirit that drove on the Cloud, on which the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was horſed, and which was one of the grimmeſt and blackeſt <hi>Devils</hi> in all <hi>Hell,</hi> grew ſowr'd and uneaſie at theſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from which Inferences might be drawn very prejudicial to the Intereſts of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or whether the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was himſelf in haſte, and expected to hear nothing new upon that Affair, he had no ſooner uttered that laſt Sentence, but we ſaw him on a ſudden hurried towards the Eaſt with an incredible Swiftneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> that ſtood on Thorns to give him Anſwer, could not forbear following him, and kept him Pace for above thirty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. He returned to us about a quarter of an Hour after, and ſpoke a little angrily. It is ſtrange how the Enemies of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> make their Inſults, and treacherouſly fall upon us, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to their Heels, without giving us ſo much as Time to put our ſelves in a Poſture of Defence, and to reply to that noiſy Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery which they think to put off at the rate of Oracles: If the <hi>Mandarin,</hi> no leſs than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had rely'd upon their Forces, and believed, as they pretend, their Arguments a Match for <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> they would not have ſhrunk when they were to grapple, and would at leaſt have tarried the Anſwer that was to be made them; but theſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46662:94"/>are <hi>Donquixots</hi> of <hi>Knight Errants,</hi> that bravado it by diſcharging a Piſtol in the Air, and never ſtand to it before the Enemy, which they make as if they did encounter. But in the Time that I have accompanied our <hi>Mandarin,</hi> I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his <hi>Ideas:</hi> He has promiſed me that this Day twelvemonth he will be again in <hi>Merſennus,</hi> where we ſhall have a fair and leiſurely Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>Demonſtrations;</hi> then, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> I deſire your Company, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and if I do not convince my <hi>Gentleman,</hi> ſo as to ſtop his Mouth for the future, I'll commence <hi>Peripatetick</hi> on the Spot, and utterly renounce <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi> We promiſed him to wait on him at that Time: But, Father, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> we have been long upon the Road, yet have made no great Progreſs in our Journey, I deſire we may diſpatch it as ſoon as poſſible, for I am in fear for my Body, and would not for a World it ſhould ſtay without me above four and twenty Hours. With that he looked towards the Earth, to ſee what Hour it was, and told me, it was but ſeven Hours ſince we left <hi>France,</hi> and provided we made no Halts in our way, in five Hours, at lateſt, we ſhall arrive in <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we left <hi>Merſennus,</hi> and departed from the <hi>Moon,</hi> by the Northſide of that <hi>Globe;</hi> we made towards the <hi>Starry Heaven</hi> with all the Speed we were capable of; that is to ſay, in one Minute we compaſs'd many thouſand Leagues. It is a prodigious, and inconceivable thing, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Stars; a Man can diſcover from the Earth, with the beſt Glaſſes, but a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Part, in reſpect of thoſe that lie out of Sight. We croſs'd the Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> where I took pleaſure in obſerving the principal Stars,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46662:94"/>that are uſually deſcrib'd on the Celeſtial Globes; that <hi>Sign</hi> reſembles an <hi>Archer</hi> near as much as <hi>I</hi> reſemble an <hi>Houſe;</hi> whereof you may imagine my two Eyes the Windows, my two Arms the Jettings that flank the Main of the Lodgings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the reſt of my Body.</p>
                  <p>Had I a mind to divert my ſelf, as <hi>Ovid</hi> does, in his Deſcription of the Chariot of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> I might make a thouſand pretty Aſtronomical Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, and could create in my Road many new <hi>Zodiacks,</hi> in which a multitude of Animals cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Fables that ſome have left behind them upon Earth, might take place, and have Reparation made for the Wrongs done them by the capriciouſneſs of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> that have given the Preheminence to others of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not half ſo great Worth and Magnitude: But the Reader may eaſily imagine to himſelf all that. I ſhall ſay no more of the Conferences we had in the reſt of our <hi>Voyage,</hi> where I was little more than <hi>Auditor.</hi> The two <hi>Peripateticks</hi> held a Diſpute almoſt all the way with <hi>Father Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> upon ſeveral Points of the <hi>New Philoſophy,</hi> but all they ſaid amounted to little more than may be ſeen in <hi>Father de la Grange</hi> and other Books, that treat of ſuch ſort of Things. It pleaſed me to ſee with what Heat each maintain'd his Party, and endeavour'd to draw me over to it; but I was ſatisfy'd in praiſing firſt one and then the other, without giving up my ſelf to either, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took upon me the Quality of Arbitrator, (which they ſeemed by common Conſent to award me) for the moderating the too great Vehemence and Zeal for the Sect that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tranſported them a little farther than
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46662:95"/>was allowable. Mean while I took notice, That <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> that conducted us, made us ſtill leave, from Time to Time, the direct Road, to fetch a Compaſs about, and aim'd to keep us at a Diſtance from the Body of the Stars, or, to ſpeak in the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Phraſe, from the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortexes.</hi> I demanded the reaſon of his doing ſo; telling him, one of my greateſt Curioſities would be to contemplate a Star at hand, and to conſider the Motion of the ſubtil Matter in the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and that, that was the readieſt way to convince me there were <hi>Vortexes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has deſcrib'd. He anſwered, it would be more convenient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my Curioſity as I returned, after that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had himſelf explained the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Determinations, the Subtil Matter is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of, in a <hi>Vortex;</hi> that thereby I ſhould better take his Meaning, and before that it would be but a new Subject of Confuſion to my ſelf, and of cavilling to the <hi>Peripatetick Gentlemen.</hi> It behoved him to hold to that, and I had from thence forward but a very ill Opinion of the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> of which I ſaw no likelihood in the Motions of the Matter at a good Remove from the Stars. But at laſt we arrived to the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> which was the End of our <hi>Voyage.</hi> The Occurrences that happened in my Stay there, ſhall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Third Part of my <hi>Relation.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Third Heaven</hi> of the <hi>World of Deſcartes,</hi> is the ſame with what the Philoſophers heretofore called the <hi>Imaginary Spaces;</hi> but ſeeing the Word <hi>Imaginary</hi> ſeemed to import nothing but what was <hi>Chimerical,</hi> and in the Imagination only he choſe rather to term it the <hi>Indefinite Spaces.</hi> There have not been wanting ſome that have ſtarted Difficulties upon the Term <hi>Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> which in ſeveral Places he ſeems to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, in the Place of <hi>Infinite,</hi> without any Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; but at laſt his Diſciples have made it <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-mode,</hi> and Cuſtom hath warranted its Uſe.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46662:96"/>As ſoon as I ſet Footing in thoſe vaſt Regions, I deſcry'd indeed the fineſt and moſt advantagl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Place poſſible to be imagin'd for the Building of a <hi>World</hi> in, nay for the Conſtruction of <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Infinite Worlds,</hi> but I ſaw no Materials proper to begin, or to make the leaſt Part of ſo great an Edifice.</p>
            <p>Having travell'd ſix or ſeven thouſand Leagues without any News or Tidings of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> we agreed to ſeparate our ſelves, that we might find him out the eaſier: <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> took one way, the Old Gentleman and I, with the two <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick</hi> Souls the other. In ſhort, <hi>Father Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> found him, and quickly after we had parted, we ſaw them both together, making towards us. The obliging way wherewith he receiv'd me, certified me, That <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> had given him a good Character of me, and ſpoke of me as a Man that in Time would prove one of his moſt zealous Followers. He likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpectfully ſaluted the two <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> but gave them to underſtand the Pains they had taken, in coming to treat of an Accommodation with him, were manifeſtly to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: That <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> had already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently advis'd him of the Propoſitions they deſign'd to offer, which he aſſured them he ſhould not be very forward to condeſcend to; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he would give them a favourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſatisfie them beforehand he had no i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Diſcourſe began with the ample Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Friendſhip, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> and the <hi>Old Stager</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:46662:96"/>made each other, mutually expreſſing the Joy they had in ſeeing one another: The <hi>Old Gentleman,</hi> out of hand took upon him to make my Elogy, ſpeaking a thouſand fine obliging things of me to <hi>Deſcartes;</hi> eſpecially he cry'd up the unintereſted Love I had for Truth, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Learning that always had appear'd in me, and the Readineſs I had promis'd, to imbrace the Inſtructions, in the Inqueſt of which I had made ſo long a <hi>Voyage.</hi> I wav'd, as modeſtly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the other Praiſes that were given me; but added, That for the Love of Truth and Deſire of Learning, I muſt ſtand up, as for my only conſiderable Accompliſhments; that as to the Readineſs I had ingag'd to receive <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s Inſtructions, that ought not to come into the Account, ſince a Maſter of his Character and Worth, and a <hi>Genius</hi> ſo Admirable and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent beyond all others, as his was, had Right to demand and require that entire Submiſſion from all that pretended to Wiſdom or Equity in the World.</p>
            <p>You are pleas'd to carry your Compliment a little too high, <hi>reply'd</hi> M.

            <p>At that my <hi>Old Sophiſter</hi> tipt the Wink upon me, which I took not at that inſtant, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Meaning of it till after. 'Tis enough, ſays <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> let us talk of ſometing elſe: Give me an account, pray, how goes <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in your World, if you have any News of it; for theſe many Years I have been ignorant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all the Concerns there, as well from the Indifference and Diſregard I have found in me ever ſince my quitting the Body, for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Men, as that Monſieur here, who is the only Perſon that has viſited me ſince, having retired in the Country many Years ago, has been incapable of hearing the Particulars of Affairs that concern <hi>Carteſianiſm,</hi> contenting himſelf to learn, and to aſſure me from Time to Time, my Philoſophy continued ſtill to have very many Friends, and very many Enemies.</p>
            <p>And I am not much better inſtructed, <hi>I anſwered,</hi> with what regards your Sect, having but begun to intereſt my ſelf in its Affairs, ſince thoſe few Days I have had the Honour of this Gentleman's Acquaintance; however, I will inform you of all that I could hear, or that has come to my Knowledg, without giving my ſelf much Trouble of Enquiry. Your <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46662:97"/>you know, was ſet up with all the Advantages and Diſadvantages of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and it has expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd the Fortune which all <hi>New Doctrins</hi> uſe to find. Many there are that have imbrac'd it with Admiration, and defended it with Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Paſſion. It hath met with the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Protection of Perſons commendable for their Parts, Capacity and Politeneſs; but almoſt all <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> have rejected it, and declared againſt it: Each acted in that as in all things elſe, according to the Principle of Self-intereſt: Some took your Side, as apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves thereby diſtinguiſh'd and advanc'd above the Herd; others deny'd it, as fearing the diminution of their Credit: The Motive and Pretence of both Parties was the Love of Truth and uncorrupt Doctrin. The Poſture of preſent Affairs hath almoſt the ſame Face ſtill; yet if we judge by the Books, whether of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Medicine,</hi> brought from <hi>England, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany, Carteſianiſm</hi> hath made very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Progreſs in thoſe Parts. Scarce once in an Age is printed any <hi>Courſe of Philoſophy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method of the Schools; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Works of that Nature, that at this Time are publick in <hi>France,</hi> are Phyſical Tracts that ſuppoſe the Principles of the <hi>New Philoſophy:</hi> Such Books as treat of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> of <hi>Metaphyſical Degrees</hi> of <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> create Fears in the Bookſellers Minds; they'll cumber themſelves with no more of them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rid their Hands of all that they have left, at any rate, as Merchants do their Stuffs when the Faſhion's over. All thoſe Queſtions, heretofore ſo famous, wherewith the Preſſes have groan'd for almoſt two hundred Years,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46662:98"/>and that have found Employment for ſo many Printers, are no where heard of but in the Schools of the Publick Profeſſors. Out of the Desks there is no talk of the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and the <hi>Nominals,</hi> at leaſt there is no Diſtinction made betwixt them; all are numbred in the ſame Predicament, and on the ſame Side which they call the <hi>Old Philoſophy,</hi> to which is oppos'd the Philoſophy of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> or the <hi>New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have had the good Fortune with your Luſtre to efface all the New Philoſophers that have riſen both in and ſince your Time; and to make uſe of a Compariſon, that bating the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Subject it is taken from, hath nothing in it but what makes for your Renown; As in <hi>Spain</hi> the Name of <hi>Lutheran</hi> is indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently given to all <hi>Hereticks</hi> of whatever Sect or Faction, ſo the Title of <hi>Carteſian</hi> is attributed to all thoſe that have undertaken to make Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Point of Natural Philoſophy. I have ſeen more than one bold Venturer, that in full Diſpute hath liſted <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> among your Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though you was undoubtedly his Junior by ſeveral Years: And I know a certain <hi>College,</hi> where the Profeſſor durſt not ſpeak of <hi>Inſenſible Matter,</hi> of the <hi>Rules</hi> of Motion, of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of <hi>Ideas,</hi> leſt he ſhould be forthwith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the reſt (excepting in the Exerciſes of ſome Honeſt Religious Perſons, that doubtleſs have no ill Deſign, but not having read you, would yet aſſume to themſelves the Honour of engaging you) that treating you as an Atheiſt, is quite out of Doors, as is the making that Propoſition a Precedent for your Religion, which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46662:98"/>you advance in the Entrance on your <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, That we muſt doubt of every Thing;</hi> yet ſome of the fineſt and cleareſt Heads do not ſtick ſeriouſly to affirm, That the late Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have robb'd you of many Diſciples; for upon their Conviction of the Real Preſence of the Sacred Body of <hi>J. C.</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they confidently aſſert the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſome of your Principles, which they are at a Fault to reconcile with the Reality of that Myſtery.</p>
            <p>But no matter, all ſuch as have a ſound and unprejudic'd Notion of Things, though they ſtand diameter to your Opinions, do you Juſtice, and give you an <hi>Encomium</hi> that ſeems none of the leaſt; which is, that they acknowledg you have open'd the Eyes of the Philoſophers of our Times to the Diſcovery of the Riſes of their Method in Philoſophy, by that juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reproach of the little Concern they had, for the moſt part, to dive to the Bottom of the Things they treat of, whether in <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> or in <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> and the little Application they bring with them, both in framing to themſelves and giving their Diſciples clear and diſtinct Ideas of the Things diſputed of; the Abuſe that was made of the ſubtilty of Mind, perverted only to the multiplying Wranglings and trifling Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, to the inventing of new Equivocal Terms, to the confounding rather than enlightning certain abſtracted Queſtions, prudently enough introduc'd the Schools, for Exerciſe and an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Diſpute and Emulation, to the Minds of Youth, but ridiculouſly made the main Streſs and Eſſentials of Philoſophy, that from thence had degenerated into an Empty Science, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46662:99"/>of Words and Terms that ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: The little Obſervation made upon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> that is the Mother of Philoſophy: The implicit Dependence they had on the Sentiment of another, often ſuperficially conſidered and ill underſtood.</p>
            <p>I can alſo aſſure you, that kind of Advice, though envidiouſly at firſt receiv'd, has not fail'd of its Effect. The <hi>Desk-Philoſophy</hi> has chang'd its Countenance in the Principal <hi>Colleges</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The moſt ingenious of the Profeſſors affect to treat of the ordinary Queſtions, and thoſe that are moſt crabbed with greater Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Method, with more Juſtneſs and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perſuaded that thoſe Queſtions thus handl'd have a greater Power than is imagined to form a Juvenile Mind, if it is capable of it, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Correct and Juſt, to accuſtom it inſenſibly to make thoſe ſo neceſſary Abſtractions, in order to the avoiding Miſtakes and Fallacies in the Train of a Reaſoning, ſpun through a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in the Examination of a Mathematical Demonſtration, the Diſcuſſion of a Phyſical Experiment, or perhaps a Political Intereſt or Concern.</p>
            <p>Since when Men are more ſhy of calling the Proofs they bring for their Opinions, <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> they are not ſo eager to declare War againſt thoſe that talk otherwiſe than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that often ſay the ſame thing. They have learn'd to doubt of certain Axioms that have hitherto been held Sacred and Inviolable, and upon Examination have ſometimes found them unworthy of ſo great a Title. <hi>Occult Qualities</hi> are under a Suſpicion, and a Cloud, having loſt conſiderably of their Reputation. The <hi>Horror</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:46662:99"/>of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is no where receiv'd but in the Shools, where no one will be at the charge of Glaſs Tubes, and certain Inſtruments which manifeſtly prove the abſurdity of that hackney'd Solution, that hath been conſtantly given to the moſt curious and extraordinary Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's of Nature. All ſort of Experiments are daily made. That of the Gravity of the Air is try'd a thouſand different ways; and there is ſcarce any little Pretender to Phyſick in the Town, but has at his Fingers ends the Hiſtory of <hi>M. Paſchal</hi>'s Experiment.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> interrupting me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what was that Experiment of <hi>M. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal?</hi> I anſwered, it was that made in the year, 1648. upon the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Domme</hi> with <hi>Torricelli</hi>'s <hi>Tube.</hi> Wherein the Quick Silver was obſerv'd to fall a great deal lower at the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than in the middle, or at the bottom; from whence hath been evidently concluded the Gravity of the Air. Does that, reply'd <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> go by the Name of <hi>M. P</hi>—'s Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment? It is then, becauſe he put it in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or rather becauſe he occaſion'd it to be practic'd by <hi>M. Perrier;</hi> for aſſuredly it is not becauſe he invented it, or foreſaw the Succeſs. And if that Experiment ought to bear the Name of its Author, it might more truly be intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Experiment of <hi>Deſcartes.</hi>

That Man is Fortunate, continu'd <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> in point of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46662:100"/>Reputation. A great many Perſons were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made to believe he had compos'd a Book of <hi>Coniques,</hi> extracted from himſelf by the meer dint of Reaſon, at ſixteen years of Age: That Book was ſent me;<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Let. <hi>38.</hi>
               </note> and before I had read it half, I concluded he had made great Advantage of <hi>Monſieur des Argues</hi>'s Inſtructions; which Conjecture, a little after was confirm'd by his own Confeſſion. What you ſay <hi>(reply'd I)</hi> a little ſurprizes me; for in the Preface to a Tract, <hi>De l' Equilibre des Liqueurs,</hi> Printed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>M. P</hi>—'s Death, your Teſtimony is quoted upon that Particular, and it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conformable to that you give at preſent: For there is no notice taken of the aſſiſtance he receiv'd from <hi>M. des Argues.</hi> It is only ſaid, the thing appear'd to you ſo prodigiouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that you would not believe it. But that you was perſuaded that <hi>M. P</hi>— the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was the genuine Author of the Piece, but was willing to confer the Honour on his Son. I know not, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> what they have made me ſpeak or think in that Preface, but I am very well aſſur'd I ſay nothing at preſent, but what I had wrote in plain Terms to <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Let. <hi>38.</hi>
               </note> after I had ſeen the Work.</p>
            <p>After all, ſaid I, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> I am not much ſurpriz'd that <hi>M. Paſchal</hi> at ſixteen years of Age, without any foreign Succour, wrote a Book of <hi>Coniques,</hi> and by chance jumpt in his Thoughts with <hi>M. Deſcartes;</hi> he that at twelve years old, before the ſight of any Books of <hi>Geometry,</hi> made himſelf particular <hi>Definitions, Figures,</hi> then <hi>Axioms,</hi> and puſh'd on his Notices ſo far, that when he was caught at his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46662:100"/>he was already arriv'd to the thirty ſecond Propoſition of the firſt Book of <hi>Euclide,</hi> which he had never read.</p>
            <p>Do you credit that, ſaid <hi>M. Deſcartes?</hi> Why ſhould I not, <hi>ſaid I!</hi> It is ſo affirm'd and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanc'd in the Preface, I have mention'd, as leaves no room to doubt of it. <hi>M. Paſchal,</hi> the Father, deſirous that his Sons firſt time ſhould be imploy'd in the gaining of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which he taught him himſelf, was cautious to conceal from him the very Names of things, that are us'd in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and conſtantly forbore to mention 'em to his Friends when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Notwithſtanding according to the Author of the Preface, <q>The Paſſion that Child had for ſuch ſort of Science, joyn'd to his pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Underſtanding, ſerv'd him inſtead of a Maſter; ſeeing his Tasks that were order'd him, rob'd him of all other opportunities, but his Hours of Recreation (a Circumſtance very remarkable) he laid out all he could of thoſe in theſe Speculations. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to make his own Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, calling a Circle a <hi>Round,</hi> a Line a <hi>Barr,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. After his <hi>Definitions,</hi> he made him <hi>Axioms;</hi> and as we proceed from one thing to another in that Science, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Reſearches ſo far, that he was arriv'd to the thirty ſecond Propoſition of <hi>Euclide.</hi> As he had made that Progreſs, his Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently entred the Room he was in, and found him ſo attentive on the Propoſition he was upon, that it was a good while before he took notice of his Approach. But it was a far greater Surprize to him, upon his Demand, What he was a doing? To hear him ſay, He
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46662:101"/>was in ſearch of ſuch a Thing, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the <hi>thirty ſecond Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>firſt Book of</hi> Euclide. He ask'd him then, What made him think of that? He anſwered, it was his Diſcovery of ſuch an other Thing; thus, as it were, analyzing and explaining his meaning ſtill, by the Names of a <hi>Barr</hi> and a <hi>Round,</hi> he came down to the <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Axioms</hi> of his own <hi>Contrivance. M. Paſchal</hi> was ſo aſtoniſh'd at the greatneſs and force of his Son's <hi>Genius,</hi> that leaving him, without ſpeaking another Word, he went at the ſame juncture to a Friend's Houſe of his, one <hi>M. Pailleur,</hi> admirable in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> When he came there, he ſtood immoveable as a Statue, and as a Man tranſported. <hi>M. Pail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur</hi> obſerving that, and ſeeing him in Tears, was very much affrighted, and pray'd him to conceal no longer from him the cauſe of his Diſpleaſure. I weep not, ſaid <hi>M. Paſchal,</hi> out of any Grief, but Joy. You know what pains I have ſtill taken to prevent all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Geometry</hi> in my Son, for fear it ſhould take him off his other Studies. Yet ſee what he has done; upon that he related all to him that I have ſaid: And <hi>M. Paſchal,</hi> by the Advice of his Friend, deſiſted to offer violence to his Son's Inclinations, who was yet but a dozen years of Age, and gave him an <hi>Euclide.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Seriouſly, ſaid I to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> do you think a Man could have the Face to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a Lye ſo methodically as this? Could any thing ſeem more probable than the Circles he calls <hi>Rounds,</hi> and the Lines that he calls <hi>Barrs?</hi> Is not that enough to perſuade us of the Truth of his <hi>Axioms,</hi> and the <hi>thirty ſecond Propoſition of</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:46662:101"/>Euclide? What can be more Natural, than the Surprizal of <hi>M. Paſchal</hi> the Father, excepting perhaps it was a little too long, who took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Cloak, and order'd his Horſes to be put in the Coach, yet remain'd, at his Arrival at <hi>M. Pilleur</hi>'s Houſe, in ſo immoveable a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, as was capable to ſcare him? After all it is very fine and extraordinary, and it would be great pity it ſhould be falſe.</p>
            <p>And I ſay (<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Deſcartes) it is greater pity that it ſhould be true, and that any ſhould believe it: For if once it be credited, that a Child of twelve years old, that hath never ſeen a Book of Geometry, and in whoſe Preſence all endeavours have been us'd to ſuppreſs the very Name of it, whoſe Mind all day long was taken up with quite different Notices, who had no time to ſpare but his hours of Recreation, which no Body probably order'd him to paſs away in Solitude, ſhould be able to frame to himſelf a Method of <hi>Geometry,</hi> invent <hi>Axioms,</hi> and arrive at laſt to the <hi>thirty ſecond Propoſition of</hi> Euclide, I ſay, if ſuch like things be once receiv'd for Truth, the <hi>Publick</hi> will become the Subject and Game on which, in a ſhort time, the moſt <hi>Romantick Panegyriſts</hi> ſhall ſport the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of their Imaginations. That way of praiſing is injurious to the Perſons prais'd, and a Commendation ſo improbable as that, renders the Truths themſelves ſuſpected, that ſhall be found in Company with it. <hi>M. Paſchal</hi> was a Man of a moſt exalted Capacity, but was far from being an <hi>Angel</hi> or a <hi>Devil.</hi> I told <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> thereupon, I chanc'd into a Company not long ſince, where one was ſpeaking much to the ſame purpoſe as he had done, upon this Topick,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46662:102"/>and there fortun'd a Gentleman to be there, a Friend to a Society that was under no mighty Obligations to <hi>M. P.</hi> who ſeeing all People ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule that Fable, ſaid, in a careleſs leering Air, that the Author of the Preface and his Friends, did, at moſt, but Juſtice to <hi>M. Paſchal,</hi> and that they had rather been too backward in that they had ſaid no more; and as he was urg'd to unmask himſelf, as to the meaning of a thing every one perceiv'd he was not very ſerious in, he added, That <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> as extravagant as it look'd to him, appear'd but a very mean return for the Obligations they were under, for his Letters to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> in which he had done 'em very ſignal Favours that were worth theſe, and that were on a more important Occaſion. To which all agreed, and 'twas acknowledg'd <hi>M. Paſchal</hi>'s Services to thoſe Gentlemen could not be repaid in a better Coin. Yet I muſt needs tell you <hi>M. P.</hi> wrote only, by the Memoirs that were given him, and that he thought true, as falſe and precarious as they were, not knowing the Spirit of a Party wherein he was ingag'd. Undoubtedly he was rather over-reach'd himſelf, than any deſign he had to impoſe on others. Let us ſay no more on this occaſion; and <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> recall'd me to the Chapter concerning <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He inquir'd then, what Strength he had in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> and moſt celebrated <hi>Colleges</hi> of <hi>France?</hi> And how his Doctrin was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there? I told him, without Ceremony, what I knew concerning it: That I knew no College that openly profeſs'd his Doctrin, that moſt of them were diſcharg'd from Teaching of it: That in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> extream care
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46662:102"/>was taken leſt the Profeſſors ſhould give too much liberty on that ſide: That <hi>Carteſianiſm</hi> had been the Debate of ſeveral <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and how that I had heard, from ſome Body, that it had been talk'd of putting it down by an Act of <hi>Parliament;</hi> it was propos'd to the late <hi>Chief Preſident, M. de la Moignon,</hi> but that that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient was not proſecuted. That the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of <hi>Caen,</hi> which next to that of <hi>Paris</hi> is the moſt flouriſhing, at leaſt, for Philoſophy, had in <hi>one Thouſand ſix Hundred Seventy ſeven,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd againſt that <hi>Doctrin,</hi> and condemn'd it as contrary to <hi>Orthodox Divinity;</hi> denying all hopes to any that ſhould undertake to maintain it, of their admiſſion to any Degree in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;</hi> and forbiding all ſuch as were already admitted, the teaching it <hi>viva voce,</hi> or by Writing, upon pain of forfeiting their Priviledges and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; that the Example of <hi>Angers</hi> had been imitated therein, that two years before had made the like Decrees, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by a <hi>Placart</hi> of the King put forth at <hi>Verſailles</hi> in the year, 1675. and that moſt of the other Univerſities had gone in imitation of the ſame Proceedings.</p>
            <p>This News chaf'd <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> And what, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> has no one in theſe occaſions undertaken my Defence? Would no <hi>Corporation,</hi> no <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> declare for my <hi>Doctrin?</hi> We have ſeen whole <hi>Orders</hi> take on them the quality of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> and <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> and to carry the Intereſts, ſome of an Univerſal <hi>a parte rei,</hi> others of an Univerſal <hi>a parte mentis,</hi> ſometimes beyond the Bounds of a laudable Emulation; whilſt a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy ſo Solid and Curious as mine, ſhall be abandon'd to the Humours and Caprice of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46662:103"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities.</hi> I had pardon'd the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that their ill-natured Behaviour, who were not oblig'd indeed to have thoſe Conſiderations for a Stranger, as I was in reſpect of them; but I could never have believ'd they would have treated me ſo in <hi>France,</hi> my Native Country; to which I am ſure I have given much Honour and Reputation. Why were my Bones tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from <hi>Sweden</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> if at the ſame time they intomb'd them with Pomp and Funeral Elogies, they blaſted my Memory throughout the <hi>Kingdom?</hi> I quitted, it's true, the World, a little with the ſooneſt: But after all, I left it not before I had acquir'd a moſt wonderful Eſteem. I had taken infallible Meaſures for the ſecuring my Party: And my Affairs had never been reduc'd to ſo damn'd a Plight, had my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples trod in my Steps, and kept their Eye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly on my Views and my Deſigns.</p>
            <p>For I muſt confeſs, ſaid he, I was not exempt from the Weakneſs and Blind Side of all Leaders of a <hi>Sect.</hi> I was concern'd for the Progreſs of my <hi>own,</hi> though I feign'd to ſeem as indifferent for that as any thing elſe; and the Hopes I had one Day to ſee it take Place of all the reſt, ſerv'd as an Incentive to encourage my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: I had drawn up my ſelf a Syſtem of my Management, for the accompliſhing my Deſign. My firſt Proſpect was that of cajoling the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ſounding them, to try if I could engage them in my Intereſts, or at leaſt make a Party among them; that would have been a Parting. Blow indeed, and my Affairs for ever after would have ſtood ſecure of any Rival or Competitor: They are poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Colleges</hi> of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and there are among them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46662:103"/>a great many Men of excellent Senſe, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of protecting my Opinions, if once they were admitted. I ſent them my Works, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to examine them, and aſſuring them,<note place="margin">Diverſes Lett. de Deſc. Tom. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> I would ſubmit them to their Judgment. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were very favourable at that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; their <hi>Provincial</hi> was my Countryman, my Friend, and my Relation: My <hi>Regent</hi> in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, who was ſtill living, and whom I had obſerv'd to be a better <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> than moſt of the Philoſophers of that Time, wiſhed me very well. In ſhort, I queſtion'd not my Succeſs; but I was highly ſurpriz'd upon <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſennus</hi> his acquainting me from <hi>Paris</hi> that <hi>Father Bourdin,</hi> the Mathematician of the <hi>Jeſuits College,</hi> had publiſh'd Theſes in oppoſition to my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. Thoſe were the firſt that appear'd againſt me in <hi>France;</hi> ſuch a Thunder-clap as that gave me quickly to underſtand how the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſtood affected, and how little Streſs I ought to lay upon the Friendſhip of ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Not long after the ſame <hi>Mathematician</hi> wrote againſt my Meditations, in no very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Style, turning them to Droll and Ridicule; which occaſion'd on my part a very ſmart and vigorous Anſwer. I complain'd thereof to <hi>Father Dinet,</hi> in a Letter that I printed with my Meditations: In a Word, an open Breach was made betwixt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and my ſelf. I deſir'd <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> very carefully to watch the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>Fathers</hi> towards me, and to give me Intelligence of all. I made a Reſolution too to fall upon them, and confute ſome one of their Printed <hi>Courſes</hi> that was moſt in Vogue; but I deſiſted from that Deſign for ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reaſons.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:46662:104"/>
            <p>Mean while I had another String to my Bow: There was ſet up a Party at that Time in <hi>France,</hi> diametrically oppoſite to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> compos'd of thoſe who write themſelves <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>'s Diſciples, and who were zealous Sticklers for <hi>M. Janſenius,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ypres</hi> his Doctrin. <hi>Monſieur Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld,</hi> as young a Doctor as he was, had already got an extraordinary Fame: In the concern I had with him upon account of ſome Objections he raiſed againſt my <hi>Meditations,</hi> which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd with the greateſt Expreſſion of Eſteem I had for his Intellectual Capacity, I found out what he was, that is, a Man ambitious of <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Novelty,</hi> and of whom one might be ſure, if once one had engaged him in a Party, recommendable with thoſe two Temptations: Therefore I was well aſſur'd of him; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Reſentment I expreſs'd towards the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> was that which moſt endear'd him: This fell out ſo well, that from thenceforth you ſhould not ſee a <hi>Janſeniſt Philoſopher</hi> that was not a <hi>Carteſian.</hi> It was likewiſe theſe Gentlemen that brought Philoſophy in Faſhion among the Ladies; and I had Advice from <hi>Paris</hi> at that Time, That nothing was more cuſtomary in their Dreſſing-Rooms than the Parallel of <hi>Monſieur d'Ypres</hi> and <hi>de Molina,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dream'd next of hooking in ſome <hi>Fraternity</hi> or other; well-remembring what I us'd to hear the late <hi>M. Janſenius</hi> ſay, <hi>That ſuch ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſpouſe an Intereſt without knowing what it is; and he was of Advice it would be of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his</hi> S. Auſtin <hi>to be ſeconded with ſome ſuch Herd; becauſe,</hi> added he, <hi>when they are once imbarqu'd, nothing can put a Stop to them</hi> pro &amp;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46662:104"/>contra. I had an Eye upon the <hi>Minim Fryers,</hi> upon the Score of <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> who was my intimate Friend, and in great Repute with the Order; but I conſider'd that though thoſe <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> had Men of Parts and Learning among them, yet they were little abroad, and taught not publickly: Again, <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> aſſur'd me, That if the Matter was brought before the Chapiter, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Party would infallibly carry it, 'cauſe of the Old ones, who had for a long Time equipt themſelves with all ſorts of Philoſophical Furniture, and would never be at the Charge of ſuting themſelves afreſh.</p>
            <p>You did well in avoiding that Game <hi>(inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our Old Gentleman)</hi> for ſince that a <hi>Father</hi> of their Order, one <hi>Father Magnan,</hi> a Rational, Underſtanding Man, ſtriking a little out of the Uſual Road, and treading in a new Track, has, as I am inform'd, been chaſtis'd in a General Chapiter, and Prohibitions have been made for any to imbrace his Principle; and ſince the main of their Studies as well as of other Seminaries, are <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> and Divinity: What is properly called <hi>Phyſicks</hi> is not very current; the Offenſive and Defenſive League entred by ſeveral Orders for <hi>Phyſical Predetermination,</hi> againſt <hi>Mean Science,</hi> is the grand concern that hath found them Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for almoſt an hundred Years.</p>
            <p>And it will continue them in Employment ſtill, (<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Deſcartes) for the ſame Reaſon as made me take thoſe Meaſures I ſpeak of, that is, becauſe <hi>Predetermination</hi> and <hi>Mean Science</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sentiments of the Order and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; a Quality I deſigned to give my Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to eternalize it: But, however, when I quitted the World, I left Things in ſo good a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46662:105"/>tendency that way, as incourag'd me to hope I had a main Party in the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>Fathers of the Oratory.</hi> It is a conſiderable Body in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs is Study, many whereof have rendred themſelves Famous by their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and their Writings. The Emulation that is between them and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Eſteem and Reſpect they have for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was enough to procure me an Hearing in their <hi>Congregation:</hi> What, have thoſe Fathers forſaken me?</p>
            <p>You make me call to Mind, ſaid I thereupon, ſome Paſſages in that Buſineſs, that may be worth your Hearing. I know not whether you have reaſon to be ſatisfy'd or diſſatisfy'd with the <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> you ſhall be Judge your ſelf. About ten or a dozen Years ago there happen'd ſome Diviſions in the Univerſity of <hi>Angers,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi>'s defending certain <hi>Theſes,</hi> wherein much New Philoſophy was interwoven, partly according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, partly according to the particular Notions of the Profeſſors:<note place="margin">Reeueil de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e qui s'eſt paſſe en l' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſite d'Angers.</note> The Univerſity took alarm at Sight of thoſe Innovations, and would not ſuffer the <hi>Theſes</hi> to paſs: She gave the Court an Account of it, and the <hi>Father General.</hi> The Court was enclin'd for the Univerſity, which oblig'd the <hi>Father General</hi> to order in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, That no one ſhould ſwerve from the Ancient Opinions, or any ways teach the New Philoſophy. But here comes a Cup of Comfort for you; ſpeedily after came out a Printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, penn'd in excellent Latin, to the Reverend <hi>Father Senault, General</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> entitul'd, <hi>Epiſtola eorum quot quot in Oratoriana Congregatione Carteſianam doctrinam amant:</hi> Wherein, after
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46662:105"/>having laid down the Motives that induc'd them to beſeech him not to ſtraiten and infringe their Minds; on that Particular were added theſe Words, <hi>ut noris quam late Carteſiana haec labes, (ſi labes eſt)— graſſetur. Pluſquam ducenti nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero ſumus, quos peſtis iſta infecit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby you ſee what Strength you had in that <hi>Congregation:</hi> Which yet was no Impediment to the Proceedure and Decree of the <hi>General Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi> in 1678. declaring ſhe imbrac'd no Party; but that ſhe always had, and would ſtill maintain that Freedom and Priviledg of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Sound and wholeſome Doctrin; and that ſhe laid reſtraint on none but ſuch as were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by the Church, or as ſavour'd of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>Baius</hi> in Divinity, or of the Opinions of <hi>Deſcartes</hi> in Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Oh the Baſe and Cowardly—cry'd <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> all enrag'd. Softly, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> I reply'd, if you your ſelf had headed a Corporation, whoſe Eſſential Intereſts you had engag'd to maintain, you would have had very different Thoughts from thoſe you now have under the Quality of a Leader of a Sect. Neither Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence nor Conſcience could oblige a Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Martyr</hi> of a Philoſopher. Matters are of a quite diſtinct Nature in Point of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> A Man may allow of the Opinions of a Philoſopher, conſider'd in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and at the ſame Time be included in ſuch Circumſtances as make it prudence to Acquieſce.</p>
            <p>But two things there are, which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerv'd to you, which ſhould make you overlook thoſe Paltry Affronts your Philoſophy has met with. The firſt is, that what is in it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46662:106"/>more choiſe and better than ordinary, begins to be authoriz'd in the Schools of the moſt zealous <hi>Peripateticks;</hi> who no longer oppoſe the Truth, that you have infus'd into them, but only ſo husband <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Stake, as it may not be ſaid that ever any Philoſopher had a clearer View than he. You know the Adventure of the laſt Age in <hi>France;</hi> the wiſeſt Heads of the Kingdom could do no otherwiſe than approve the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of the Regulations made in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> notwithſtanding there were Reaſons that obſtructed the adhereing to that Council, on Diſcipline-account. What was done? The States of <hi>Blois</hi> made Ordinances exactly like a great Part of the Decrees of that Council: Thus, without admiting the Council, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in effect the Purport of it. The <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi> have in ſome ſort tranſcrib'd the Conduct of thoſe grave <hi>Politicians.</hi> 'Tis a Crime among them to be a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> but 'tis an Honour to make good Uſe of the beſt Part of <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> And to compare the Fortune of your Doctrin with that of another that in our Days hath made ſuch a Buſtle in the World, before the Propoſitions of <hi>Janſenius</hi> had been condemn'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> his Followers highly complimented him upon them: His was the Pure and Uncorrupt Doctrin that was copied from the great S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin;</hi> but they had no ſooner been cenſur'd as Heretical, but they vaniſh'd in a Trice, and could not be found in <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book: No one could heartily believe they ever had been there, and in Spight of Bulls of <hi>Popes</hi> and Ordinances of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> 'twas reckon'd a Mortal Sin to ſign a Condemnation of Propoſitions, and a Form of Faith, without the Diſtinction of <hi>De Jure &amp; de
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46662:106"/>Facto.</hi> The quite contrary happen'd in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair I am ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>At firſt, when the <hi>Carteſians</hi> made Mention of <hi>Subtil Matter,</hi> and ridicul'd the <hi>Horror</hi> of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> talk'd of the <hi>Elaſtick</hi> Vertue of the Air, the Preſſure of its Columns, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Impreſſion of Objects on our Senſes, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was brought to confront them with a quite contrary Doctrin.</p>
            <p>Since that Time, upon Examination of the Reaſons on which your Propoſitions in thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances depended, they would not ſay that you were in the Right; but many undertook to affirm, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had taught the greateſt Part of that before you. There hath been ſince diſcover'd in his Writings an <hi>Ethereal Matter,</hi> the manner of <hi>Senſations</hi> by the <hi>Concuſſion</hi> of the <hi>Organs;</hi> the Demonſtration of the <hi>Gravity</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and the moſt delicate Truths of the <hi>Equilibrium</hi> of Liquors: So inſtead of the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> abandoning, or ſeeming to abandon the <hi>Right,</hi> and ſheltering themſelves under the <hi>Fact,</hi> the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> fall on Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Right</hi> by the <hi>Fact</hi> itſelf; that is, the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> now find in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> what according to themſelves had not been viſible for theſe thirty Years. On the contrary, the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> have loſt Sight of the Propoſitions they had pointed to us hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, before they were condemn'd: So that would you make any Abatements, as I hope you will, that I may make good my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I made <hi>Voetius</hi> your Old Friend in <hi>Holland,</hi> we ſhould ſee <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> turn <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle Carteſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:46662:107"/>
            <p>The other Thing, that is Matter of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you, and that in Defiance to all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of your Enemies muſt encourage you to hope for the Immortality of <hi>Carteſianiſm,</hi> is the uncontroulable Liberty that's left to every one of Writing for and againſt it: And that at this Day the moſt Solid and Ingenious Patron of the New Philoſophy, is a celebrated <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> whoſe Books are in great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He forthwith requir'd his Name and Character. He is call'd, ſaid I, <hi>Father Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche:</hi> He's a Man of an extraordinary pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment, of profound Thought, that has a wonderful Gift at methodizing his Reflections, which he opens and diſplays in the neateſt and moſt lively manner imaginable; that knows however to give an Air of Truth and a probable Turn, to the moſt extraordinary and abſtracted Notions; that is skill'd to the utmoſt Perfection, in preparing the Mind of his Reader, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſing him in his own Thoughts. In ſhort, he is the moſt charming <hi>Carteſian</hi> that I know. His principal Work is called, <hi>The Search of Truth;</hi> and it is from that in particular that he hath been acknowledg'd for ſuch as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him: Yet I cannot conceal from you a little Accident that may ſomewhat allay the Joy that News muſt excite in you; which is, That this Illuſtrious Champion of the New Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, has been ſometime ſince at Variance with <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> whoſe Friend he had ever been before, which made a kind of Civil War. The Onſet and Defence on both Sides is manag'd with Vigor and Courage; each of them combate in their own way: Volumes of five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pages apiece are ſent out by <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46662:107"/>the turning of an Hand: The other is leſs luxuriant, but more ſtrict and preſſing: He takes thoſe Captains for his Precedent, who only make uſe of ſome ſelect Troops, without any regard to Number, that always march cloſe and in good Order, who let the Enemy wheel about as often as they pleaſe, but are ſure to break their Ranks whenever they ſee an Advantage. Diſcourſe is various concerning the Motives of that War; <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> is the Aggreſſor: The moſt reſin'd Politicians, who, as you know, never fail to make the beſt of their Talent on ſuch Occaſions, ſay, It is a Trick and Evaſion of the <hi>Old Doctor,</hi> who has ſeveral other ſuch at command. Some Years ago there appear'd two Books againſt him; one was titul'd, <hi>The Spirit of</hi> M. Arnauld, wrote by a <hi>French Protestant Minister,</hi> retir'd to <hi>Holland;</hi> that's a very roguiſh Book, I muſt confeſs, and full of Venom and Gall, but he leaves <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> inextricably in the Briars; he not only turns his own Weapons upon him, but alſo againſt the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and concludes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the Principles and Practice of <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> that moſt of the Arguments he takes to be moſt forcible and Advantagious to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> are nul and inſignificant, are meer Shew and Out-ſide, ſit only to dazle the Eyes of the Ignorant, and ſuch as cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the Bottom of Things.</p>
            <p>The other Book, which was printed the firſt of the two, but was not made publick till ſome time after, was written by a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> againſt a <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd, <hi>The</hi> Mons <hi>New Testament,</hi> done by the Gentlemen <hi>du Port Royal,</hi> and whereof <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> took upon him the Patronage and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46662:108"/>Defence. That Book of the Jeſuite is Solidly, Scholar-like and Politely wrote. He very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently comes over <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> on many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and adds from time to time, in thoſe Places, he challenges him to give an Anſwer to ſuch and ſuch a Point: Notwithſtanding, thoſe two Books found no Reply; and no one could ſay they were unanſwer'd, becauſe they were deſpiſed and did not deſerve the Pains. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf was ingag'd, that Anſwer ſhould be made the firſt (as hath ſince been done by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand) and <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>'s Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation were intereſs'd to ſatisfy the Scruples, the Evidence of Fact, and the Force of Reaſons in the ſecond, had rais'd in the Minds of Men. See then what was the ſenſe of the <hi>Politicians</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis known by long Experience, that <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> never us'd to be very Dormant in the caſe of Books wrote againſt him. Whence then proceeds this extraordinary Patience, he would fain ſeem to have at preſent? Whence comes it, that inſtead of defending himſelf againſt his Enemies, that make voluntary Inſults to attack him, and fall ſo foully on him, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf new Adverſaries, and out of a gayety of Humour falls to Daggers-drawing with his Friends and Allies, whilſt his Country is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to the Pillage and Deſcretion of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Here is, ſay they, the ſhort and the long of the Buſineſs. Thoſe two Books <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus M. Arnauld.</hi> The firſt upon ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles preſents you with an <hi>Argumentum ad Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and is beyond Reply. The ſecond is penn'd with that Circumſpection and Exactneſs, as Wards off all Paſſes, gives not the leaſt hold,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46662:108"/>and blocks up all the out-lets, where ere his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary might eſcape him. It would be no part of Prudence to engage on ſo diſadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms. He muſt not, however, be ſeen to baulk or decline the Challenge; (and beſides <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> had reſolv'd to leave the World, whenever he deſiſted to make a noiſe in it, and to Write and Diſpute whatever it coſt him:) Therefore he cunningly procures himſelf a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. He picks a random Quarrel with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malebranche,</hi> threatning an Attack on a Treatiſe of his, concerning <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which he had preſum'd to publiſh contrary to his Advice. He compiles a great Volume, againſt two or three Chapters of the <hi>Reſearch of Truth.</hi> That Book is anſwered. <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> thereupon makes his Reply. <hi>Father Malebranche</hi> charges again. <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> makes yet another Onſet. Here ſome are inquiſitive, why <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> neglects to anſwer both <hi>M. Juriou</hi> and the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue?</hi> Hey day! cry others, how would you have him anſwer them? Does not <hi>Father Malebranche</hi> find him his Hands full? Whoſe little Volumes he's forc'd to overwhelm with bulky Books, to obſtruct the entrance of that monſtrous Impiety into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrin of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real God: Without which no Man can find out what he means by his intelligible Extenſion, that is, he ſays, in God. However the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is urgent and requires Diſpatch. But what would you have a Man do? they add. Is it poſſible he ſhould be every where at once? Whilſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> march'd with all the Forces of his Kingdom to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> was he not neceſſitated to ſuffer the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46662:109"/>Garriſon of <hi>Kaminiec</hi> to over-run <hi>Podolia,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> to inſlave <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>craine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If that Conjecture is not true, ſaid <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> it is however very probable, and thoſe Gameſters play the Politician not amiſs. But what <hi>(purſu'd he)</hi> is the Subject of Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe two famous Authors? For I aſſure you, I perceive a Concern upon me, upon their Account. The Matter in Debate <hi>(I anſwer'd)</hi> is of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the manner of our apprehending Objects that are without us. <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> would have it, that our <hi>Idea's</hi> are nothing but the Modifications of our Soul. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malebranche</hi> pretends, that that Opinion is unwarrantable, and maintains we have no other perception of Objects than in God; who being every where, is intimately united with our Soul, and who following the general Laws of the Union of the Body and Soul, communicates to us the Idea of the Object that he hath in himſelf, and at once makes us apprehend the Impreſſion of it. Both one and the other ſtrive upon occaſion, to ingage you on their ſide, or to ſhew rather, that they advance nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to your Thoughts upon Ideas: But I am of Opinion, you never penetrated ſo deep in that Affair, as that either of them can gain much by your Authority.</p>
            <p>What you ſay of me is true (<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes;) but which at laſt of theſe two Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have got the better on't? I anſwer'd him, I was not raſh and inconſiderate enough, to ſet up for a Decider of the Difference and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of thoſe two Hero's: That I could only ſay that they fell to't in earneſt: That though
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46662:109"/>
               <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> had propos'd to himſelf the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring <hi>Father Malebranche</hi>'s Tract of <hi>Nature</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> he thought it adviſable to begin with the Confutation of what he had written touching Idea's in his <hi>Search of Truth,</hi> looking on that paſt (to uſe his Thought and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) as the Outworks of the place he had a Deſign to ruin. That the Subject being very Abſtracted and Metaphyſical, and above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Capacity of Men, and <hi>Father Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi>'s Syſtem on that Particular, requiring a very great Attention to comprehend it, <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> ſeem'd to have taken deſignedly that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Aſſault, for the making a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Effort on his Adverſary; but that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malebranche,</hi> without giving up his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, wherein he acquit himſelf admirably well, had drawn them into the Body of the place, that is to ſay, had incorporated them with the Intereſts of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious Ground, and too ſlippery a ſtand for <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> where he was very cloſely preſs'd. Yet that I durſt not undertake for the Succeſs of <hi>Father Malebranche</hi>'s Self on that Side, becauſe of the great Experience of <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> in ſuch ſort of War, wherein he undoubtedly merits the Encomium <hi>Admiral Chatillon</hi> uſed to give himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> He had wherewith to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the greateſt Captains that ever were, in that having been always beaten by his Enemies, having loſt all the Battles he had been oblig'd to Fight, after all his Misfortunes, he ſtill ſtood upon his Legs, in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Party, and bearing ſtill a Part and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, able to diſquiet thoſe by whom he had been worſted. I might likewiſe add, without
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46662:110"/>affronting <hi>Father Malebranche,</hi> he is already ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the loſs he has ſuſtain'd ſince that firſt Breach: For before that unhappineſs, and whilſt he was a Friend of <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> he was every where extoll'd for a ſublime and infinitely penetrating Genius; and at preſent, he's a Man that ſpeaks nothing but Perplexities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, whom one can neither underſtand nor follow without danger of Error: So true it is that <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>'s Friendſhip is at this day, as it ever has been, a prodigious bank of Merit to thoſe that are ſo fortunate to injoy it, and that Societies, no leſs than particular Perſons that were deſtitute of that Advantage, would be very little better for their Reputation.</p>
            <p>As I was thus entertaining Diſcourſe with <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> I perceiv'd in an Inſtant a change in me, that carry'd ſomething in it much like what we experience in ſome ſudden Faintings, wherein all things ſeem to alter and turn colour. I could never have believ'd a Soul ſeparate from the Body, had been capable of ſuch an Accident, <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> who was aware of it, and well underſtood the cauſe, left me for a moment to wait on <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Embaſſadors.</hi> I knew not what Intercourſe they had, till the <hi>old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Information, on our return to th'other World. He told me <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> declin'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring all Diſpute and Buſineſs with them; only aſſuring them he had not the leaſt Deſign of making any Inroad into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Dominions; but that he thought it a difficult piece of Work to effect a through Accommodation; and that it would be proper for each to preſerve their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Opinion, as before, without being reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and concern'd to bring over that of others
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46662:110"/>to it; notwithſtanding to the end their Voyage might not be wholly ineffectual, he promis'd to ſee that the <hi>Carteſians</hi> behav'd themſelves with greater Reſpect and Eſteem towards <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> upon condition <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would reſtrain the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> from flying out with that out-rage againſt <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to my Spiritual <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> I knew not the reaſon of that neither till my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and it was this. We muſt ſuppoſe that as long as our Soul is united with our Body, the moſt part of its Ideas and Conceptions depend on the diſpoſition of our Brain. The diverſity of that Diſpoſition conſiſts, as ſay the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks,</hi> in the difference of the <hi>Species,</hi> Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Images of Objects, contain'd in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the Brain, or imprinted on its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The <hi>new Philoſophers</hi> more truly ſay, That thoſe kind of Pictures are nothing but the Traces and Footſteps ſtampt on the Brain, by the ordinary Current of the Animal Spirits, that flow in great Plenty, as in little Rivers, and wear themſelves a kind of Channel, to which they uſually keep. In what way ſoever that different Diſpoſition cauſes the different Idea's and different Judgments of the Soul (for it is an inſcrutable Myſtery) it is certain it is done, and that different Ideas ſuppoſe different Traces. So that ſhould a diſſection be made of a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> and a <hi>Carteſian</hi> Brain, with the help of good Microſcopes, for the diſcovery of thoſe Prints that are exquiſitely fine, one ſhould ſee a prodigious difference in the Complexion of thoſe two Brains. I never indeed queſtion'd that Truth, but I thought that dependence of the Soul laſted no longer than it was in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46662:111"/>Body, and that as ſoon as the Separation was perform'd, it had no more Correſpondence with it: But I experimented the contrary, and my Fellow-Travellers aſſur'd me that ſo long as the Body has its Organs ſound and free, let the Soul be ten thouſand Worlds apart, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame Impreſſions, as if it reſided in it: And that if <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Snuſh had not lax'd the ſenſitive Nerves, I ſhould have ſeen, whilſt I was in <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s World all the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies, the Eyes of my Body were preſented with. I ſhould have heard every noiſe that beat upon the Drum of my Ears: And ſo of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>So aſtoniſhing an Effect as this makes no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Souls: For if they be <hi>Peripateticks</hi> they preſently explain it by the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> betwixt the Soul and Body of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; and if they be <hi>Carteſians</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it by the general Laws of the Soul and Bodies Union, which is in cauſe that God on occaſion of ſuch and ſuch Motions made in the Body, produces ſuch and ſuch Thoughts or Perceptions in the Soul; and ſay they, one of theſe Laws is, That whilſt the Organs of the Body are capacitated for Imployment, the Soul wherever ſhe is, receives the Impreſſions of Objects that affect them; it being as eaſy a thing for God to advertiſe the Soul of that Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when ſhe is remote from the Body, as when preſent, proximity of Place being wholly inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant in the thing; ſince, according to them, the Motion of the Organs is not the real cauſe that produces <hi>Senſations,</hi> but only the occaſional cauſe, that is, that which offers an occaſion to <hi>God Almighty</hi> of producing them in the Soul.</p>

            <p>My Old Gentleman then, as I was ſaying, in our Return confeſs'd the Trick <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> and himſelf had agreed to play me: They had given Inſtructions, before they departed, to the <hi>little Negro,</hi> that was commiſſion'd to guard my <hi>Corps,</hi> at ſuch an Hour, in which they eaſily foreſaw we ſhould be arriv'd to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> to take Care ſo to determine the Animal Spirits in my Brain, as they might no longer keep the beaten Tracks they had been us'd to, for the exciting <hi>Peripatetick Species</hi> in my Mind, but to make them glide in ſuch a Current as was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and as he knew how, for the implanting <hi>Carteſian Ideas</hi> in their Room; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with that Dexterity, that whether it was by the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> of <hi>Sympathy,</hi> or by vertue of the <hi>General Laws</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the Body and Soul, my Notions were all in an inſtant turn'd topſie turvy: And I, that a Moment ſince could ſee nothing in that <hi>Immenſe Space,</hi> in which I was, began to perceive <hi>Matter</hi> there, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that <hi>Space, Extenſion</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> were all one and the ſame thing. After which, as often as <hi>M. Decſartes</hi> bade us to conceive how ſuch and ſuch Motions were effected in Matter, I ſaw them more diſtinctly than your moſt clarify'd <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do your <hi>Chamfer'd</hi> Parts of Matter wreath'd in ſhape of little Skrews, by the Struggle they have to ſqueez betwixt the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> or to conſtitute a little <hi>Vortex,</hi> round the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> and to cauſe that wonderful affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that is found betwixt that Stone and the Poles of the Earth, and with it and Iron.</p>
            <p>It is plain that an Univerſal Revolution of Ideas, like this, cannot happen in the Soul, without cauſing an extraordinary Commotion in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46662:112"/>its Subſtance, no more than a general Alteration of Humors can occur in the Body, without a Change of its Conſtitution. I was therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpriz'd at ſo prodigious a Change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly unable to give any probable Gueſs at its Cauſe, but could not help attributing it to ſome Secret in <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Philoſophy; who returning quickly after, addreſs'd me in a more Familiar Air than at my firſt Reception. Well, what, ſhall we begin to fall to work upon our World? I ſee you are at preſent capable and worthy of reaping that Satisfaction. Monſieur, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> I know not where I am, nor what I ought to think of my ſelf: But certainly nothing can more effectually diſpoſe me to a Belief that you are capable of becoming the Creator of a World, than that Power you manifeſt over Spirits. Yes, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> I acknowledg <hi>Space, Matter</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi> to be the ſelf-ſame Thing: I ſee plainly in that Space, Materials for the Building a <hi>New World;</hi> and if you once accompliſh ſo vaſt and prodigious a Work, from this Time forward I renounce my Body to live here with you for ever and ever, to the End of the World, nothing ſeeming comparable to the Advantage of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the moſt Wiſe and Puiſſant Soul, that ever came out of the Almighty's Hands.</p>
            <p>You'l be better advis'd than that, reply'd <hi>M. Deſcartes;</hi> it behoves you to expect the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Sovereign Being</hi> for an entire Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from your Body; nor is there any Neceſſity for it, to have all the Satisfaction that you wiſh. In leſs than two Hours Time I'll make you a <hi>World,</hi> wherein ſhall be a <hi>Sun,</hi> an <hi>Earth, Planets, Comets,</hi> and every thing you ſee more Curious and obſervable in yours; and ſince this World
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46662:112"/>I am about to make is not to ſtand for good and all, but is only an Eſſay of another I intend to build at my Leiſure, of far greater Capacity and Perfection; I can eaſily interrupt and break the Motions, to let you ſee in a little Time the different Changes, which occur not in the Parts of the great World, but in the Proceſs of Years</p>
            <p>Come on then, let us begin, ſaid he, but follow me exactly in the Principles I lay down, and the Reflections I ſhall make you obſerve: Above all interrupt me not. After theſe few Words <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> prepar'd himſelf for the executing his Projection: Which was by the Expoſition, or rather Suppoſition of ſome of his moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Principles, thought neceſſary to qualifie us for the comprehending the Diſpatch of that grand Maſter-piece.</p>
            <p>Conceive, in the firſt Place <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> that all this <hi>vaſt Space</hi> is <hi>Matter:</hi> For this Space is <hi>extended,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> is not capable of being ſo. This Space therefore is an extended Subſtance, or which is the ſame Thing, <hi>Matter.</hi> Whoever can doubt of this Truth, can doubt if a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain can be without a Valley. Conceive in the ſecond Place, That in Nature there are two inviolable Laws: The firſt is, That every Body will ever maintain the Poſt and Capacity it has once been put in, will never change it till ſome External Cauſe ſhall force it; if it is in reſt, it will be in Reſt eternally; if it is in Motion it will continue eternally in Motion; if it is of a Square Figure it will preſerve its Square Figure always.</p>
            <p>The Second is, That a Body always naturally continues its Motion in a right Line, though the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46662:113"/>rencounter and juſtling of other Bodies fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſturb it from its Regular Courſe, and from hence follows an indiſputable Principle, confirm'd by infinite Experiments; <hi>viz.</hi> That a Body, circularly moved, conſtantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get farther from the Centre of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if it fortune to get rid of a Body or Bodies, that conſtrain it to move circularly, it is always ſure to make its eſcape by the <hi>Tangent</hi> of the <hi>Circle</hi> it deſcrib'd, in its Motion.</p>
            <figure>
               <p>The Line <hi>A G</hi> is the Tangent, the Stone would deſcribe, ſuppoſing it to be freed from the Sling at the Point <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
            </figure>
            <p>Theſe Principles are the rich and fruitful Sources of that Infinity of admirable Truths, of which <hi>True Philoſophy</hi> is compos'd, and the only Rules I will and ought to follow, in the Production of the <hi>World</hi> I am about.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46662:113"/>
            <p>This ſhort Speech ended, I was wonderfully edify'd in ſeeing <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> fall to Prayers, and make an humble Acknowledgment to God of all thoſe intellectual Gifts and Bleſſings he had vouchſaf'd him.</p>
            <p>Sovereign Being <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> thou beareſt me witneſs, That never Mortal acknowledg'd that abſolute Dominion thou haſt over all thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with greater Reſpect and Submiſſion than my ſelf: So long as I had my Being in the Land of the Living, I made it my Buſineſs to convince Men of that entire Dependence they have on thee, having perſuaded many of that important Truth, That thou art the only Being which can produce every thing in the World: That it is a puniſhable Pride in Men to conceit themſelves capable of cauſing the leaſt Motion imaginable in Matter; and that the very Motion their Soul ſuppoſes ſhe influences on the Body, which ſhe animates, is purely the effect of thy Almighty Power, that in concurrence with the Laws thy Wiſdom itſelf has confirm'd, moves the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body with ſuch exactneſs and celerity, on occaſion of the Deſires and Inclinations of the Soul, as perſuades her, it is herſelf that moves them; though at the ſame Time ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes her Ignorance of the manner whereby it muſt be done. That bright and lively influx, wherewith thou haſt enlightned my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath guided me out of that Laberynth of common Deluſion, and open'd me the way and Method I ought to take, in the Study and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of thy wonderful Works. Though I at preſent undertake to work upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Matter, which thy infinite Bounty ſeems to have left at my Diſpoſal, and though I have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46662:114"/>aſſum'd the Freedom of warranting my Diſciples the <hi>Production</hi> of a <hi>World</hi> like that of thy own Making; yet it is wholly in Dependence on thy Power I have made this account. Yea, Lord, I ſhall contribute in no wiſe to that Operation, but by the Deſires of my Will, which thou out of thy gracious Goodneſs wilt be pleaſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by impreſſing ſo much Motion on this Matter as I ſhall wiſh for, and by giving this Motion Determinations neceſſary to the End which I propoſe; Reaſon and Experience having taught me, That every pure Spirit, ſuch as am I my ſelf, by one of the Univerſal Rules, to which thou conformeſt thy external Actions, hath Right and Priviledg of ſo much Motion as is ſufficient to move the Matter of a World. Manifeſt then, Lord, thy Power in Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Spiritual Creature, that makes this humble Confeſſion of his Weakneſs, and give us farther occaſion to praiſe and glorifie thy Name.</p>
            <p>Having finiſh'd his Devotion, <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> mark'd out a round Space, of about five hundred Leagues diameter, for the making a little Sampler of his World, whereupon thus he ſpake.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I ſhall at preſent only repreſent you the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> of your World, and all that is therein; that is to ſay, the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Planets,</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> the Diſpoſition of its principal Parts, and the different Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Dependences they have on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if you will honour me with a Viſit ſome Years hence, you ſhall ſee the <hi>Great World</hi> finiſh'd.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:46662:114"/>
            <p>The firſt thing I ſhall do is to divide in almoſt equal Parts all the Matter comprehended in the Space I have chalk'd out. All thoſe Parts ſhall be very Small, but yet they muſt be leſs before I have done with them: They muſt not all be of a Spherical Figure, 'cauſe if they were all ſo ſhap'd, there muſt neceſſarily be an Interval, or <hi>Void</hi> betwixt them: But a <hi>Void</hi> is impoſſible; they muſt therefore be of all Shapes and Figures, but angular for the generality.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the Union of the Parts of Matter purely conſiſt in that Repoſe they are in, one by another; that Diviſion I propoſe to make, will laſt no longer than I ſhall agitate them ſeveral ways, and drive them on every Side.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since the Fluidity of Matter is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Motion of its ſmalleſt Parts, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated different ways; upon my Diviſion and Agitation of it in that wiſe, I ſhall make it fluid, as hard and conſiſtent as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Again, this round Space of five hundred Leagues, which I have cut out for the building of my little World, being once made fluid, I ſhall divide it into twenty Parts, or twenty <hi>Vortexes,</hi> that ſhall be ſeverally conſtituted of infinite inſenſible Parts of Matter.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:46662:115"/>
            <figure>
               <p>
                  <hi>S</hi> The Vortex of the Sun.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>For the comprehending what I mean by this Word <hi>Vortex;</hi> imagine to your ſelf a round or oval Space of Matter, which I divide in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or ten thouſand little Parts. Suppoſe theſe little Parts, ſo many little Giggs, each made to turn about their Axle or their Centre; and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46662:115"/>and bowl'd at the ſame time about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of that round or oval Space; and this is what I call a <hi>Vortex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you muſt conceive each <hi>Vortex</hi> as a kind of <hi>Firmament,</hi> at whoſe Centre will be an <hi>Aſtre</hi> or fix'd Star; ſo that in making <hi>twenty Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes,</hi> in the Space which I have laid out, I ſhall make twenty <hi>fix'd Stars:</hi> But at theſe <hi>fix'd Stars</hi> you'l be ſurpriz'd, and will have the pleaſure of obſerving, that but one in twenty will continue, which will repreſent your <hi>Sun:</hi> All the reſt will become partly <hi>Planets,</hi> partly <hi>Comets:</hi> Nor will there of thoſe twenty, above one great <hi>Vortex</hi> remain, which will be that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in which will be form'd two little new ones, to repreſent the <hi>Vortex</hi> of your <hi>Earth,</hi> and that of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> This will be ſufficient, <hi>Monſieur, ſaid he,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to me in particular, to qualify you for the comprehending the Work I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compleat. For the reſt of my Principles and Concluſions, which you have ſeen in my Phyſicks, I ſhall more commodiouſly explain them in the performance it ſelf, as occaſion ſhall be offer'd.</p>
            <p>With that <hi>M. Deſcartes, Father Merſennus,</hi> and my old Gentleman, betook themſelves to three different Stations in the Space, and began to agitate and churn the Matter with a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Alacrity. The twenty <hi>Vortexes</hi> were come in an Inſtant, each having their Motion deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd on every ſide, and being ſo order'd that the <hi>Poles</hi> of <hi>one Vortex</hi> were terminated at the <hi>Eclyptick</hi> of an <hi>other.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> calls the <hi>Circle</hi> of a <hi>Vortex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. <hi>3.</hi> Princip.</note> that which is remoteſt from its <hi>Poles.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:46662:116"/>
            <p>Whereas the parts of every <hi>Vortex</hi> were ſeen out of hand to be figured Angularwiſe for the generality, and to move round about their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, there was a mighty grating and claſhing occaſion'd by the Fraction of Angles, that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followed the Struggle every Part made to turn its ſelf about its own Centre. And that was the firſt Reflection <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> occaſioned me to make, for the explaining to me the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and Production of the <hi>Elements,</hi> as they are diſtinguiſh'd in his <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> You ſee, ſaid he, how from the agitation of Matter neceſſarily iſſue the <hi>Elements,</hi> at which the Philoſophers of your World have blanched and bogled ſo. From a <hi>Cube</hi> or any <hi>Angular</hi> Body whatſoever, to make a <hi>round</hi> one, what more is required than the paring off the Angles and Inequalities that are found in the Surface of it? And what but this is done in the Motion I have impreſſed on all the little parts about their Centre? Is it poſſible they ſhould turn thus without a mutual Unhorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another? And can that continual rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of one againſt another, fail to poliſh them more exactly than if they had been turn'd in a Lathe? Theſe little Balls conſtitute that kind of Matter which I call my <hi>ſecond Element.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in the Interim of the ſhivering of theſe Angles, you ſee (and 'tis impoſſible to be otherwiſe) there is a World of little <hi>Filings,</hi> prodigiouſly leſs than the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Element;</hi> and it is that diminutive Duſt which I call the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>firſt Element.</hi> But laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, among the parts of the firſt Element, as minute as they are, there are ſome leſs than others, and whereas they are nothing but the Scrapings of the ſecond Element, they are of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46662:116"/>very irregular Figures, and full of Angles: Which is the reaſon they entangle and fetter themſelves with one another, and cake into a <hi>ragged</hi> and <hi>groſs Maſs,</hi> which I call the Matter of the <hi>third Element:</hi> And theſe are my <hi>three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which as you ſee, I had reaſon to defy the World to find a fault with.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was ſome Moments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to me, being extraordinary buſy in the management of his Project, and the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal regulation of the firſt Motions of his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes.</hi> Mean while the little parts of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of every <hi>Vortex,</hi> by the means of their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Centre and rubbing againſt each other, even'd and poliſh'd themſelves by little and little, and ſtill as they became perfectly Globular, they loſt of their Bulk and decreas'd in Size. Then it was that I began to ſee the Conſequences of the Rules of Motion, which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had readily ſuppos'd. For ſeeing theſe little Balls took up leſs room than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſeeing they kept ſtill a turning round, and their Figure rendred them more fit for Motion, I perceived them preſently to quit the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and to gain the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. By that Effort obliging the Matter of the <hi>firſt Element,</hi> that was diſpers'd through all the <hi>Vortex,</hi> to fall down to the Centre; and to conſtitute a Maſs of that extreamly fine and powdered Duſt, that ſtill whirl'd round, and attempted to recover the Circumference from which the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Element</hi> had chas'd it: But all in vain, becauſe the <hi>Figure</hi> of the parts of the <hi>ſecond Element</hi> maintained them in their Poſt; and all that could poſſibly be done by the Matter of the <hi>first,</hi> was upon occaſion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46662:117"/>to ſlip into the Intervals, the Balls in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> ſometimes left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
            <p>The Satisfaction <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> obſerv'd I took at that petty Play, and the Facility I manifeſted in perceiving or conceiving whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, highly pleaſed him, and engaged him to explain to me one of the moſt curious Myſteries in Philoſophy. I could wiſh, ſaid he, you had your Body here, you would let in thoſe admirable Deductions from the Principles I have laid, with a greater <hi>Gusto</hi> and Delight. Now you only ſee in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortexes</hi> a heap of Duſt or of ſubtil Matter, of the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but had you your Body and your Organs with you, capable of the Impreſſions that heap of Duſt would make, you'd ſee for every heap of Duſt a <hi>Sun. Monſieur (continued he)</hi> that very <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Splendour and Beauty you ſo often have admir'd in your World is nothing, in affect, but an Amaſs of that ſame Duſt; but Duſt inſtigated with ſuch a Motion as I explain in my Philoſophy, and you at preſent ſee.</p>
            <p>To give you a clear Inſight in this Matter, I need only ſuppoſe one thing; which I am ſure you wont deny me; and which, on occaſion, I could ſhew you in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, to wit, that <hi>Viſion</hi> is cauſed meerly by the <hi>vibration</hi> of the <hi>Threds</hi> wherewith the optick Nerve is wrought. And it is on Account of that <hi>vibration,</hi> that a Man falling rudely on his Head, or who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark, runs his Face againſt a Poſt, ſees a ſudden flaſh of Light like the glaring of a Candle. It tortures the <hi>Naturalists</hi> to explain the manner how that vibration cauſes us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all luminous and bright Objects. Upon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46662:117"/>what <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſoever they proceed, they meet with inconquerable Difficulties: But at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and in earneſt it is no more than this.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>He then went on in explaining to me all the Properties of Light, and the Demonſtrations he hath given concerning the Reflection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of its Rays. He was very large and copious upon that Subject: For that piece of his Philoſophy, together with that where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of the Loadſtone, is his darling and beloved Theam. I ſhall not deſcend to the Particulars of that Diſcourſe, for fear of wearying my Reader, as alſo frightning ſome, to whom Lines croſſing one another with A. B. C. are as terrible as Magick, and the ſight thereof enough to make them ſhut the Book, and never open it after. And this is the Reaſon I will make uſe of them as little as poſſibly I can.</p>
            <p>He would not for any thing whatever have forgotten to remark to me thoſe little channel'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46662:118"/>Parts, whoſe Service is ſo very neceſſary to him, nor the way that they are wrought. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Parts of the <hi>firſt Element,</hi> which are made of the <hi>filings</hi> of the <hi>Second,</hi> there are ſome, that by reaſon of their irregular Figure, are not ſo rapid as the other. Thoſe of this Nature eaſily hook themſelves together, and make up little Bodies larger than the other parts of the <hi>firſt Element;</hi> and as in their turning about, they are often obliged to paſs betwixt the Balls of the <hi>ſecond Element,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb <hi>90.</hi>
               </note> they accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for that Paſſage, and as they ſqueeze be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, wrythe themſelves into the Shape of a <hi>Skrew,</hi> or become like little Pillars cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd with three Furrows, or gutterwork'd and tourn'd as you ſee the Shell of a Snail. They are chiefly to be found toward the Poles of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> having their Determination toward the Centre. Now whereas ſome of them enter by way of the Northern Pole, others by the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, whilſt the <hi>Vortex</hi> turns upon its <hi>Axis;</hi> it is apparent to every <hi>Carteſian,</hi> that thoſe which proceed from the North-Coaſt muſt be turned Shell-wiſe a different way, from thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the South. An Inſtance <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> took care to inculcate throughly in me: For it is principally upon that, the Power and Vertue of the Loadſtone do depend:<note place="margin">Numb. <hi>91.</hi>
               </note> But it ſhall not be long, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> before you ſee ſome particular Effect of theſe little channel'd Parts.</p>
            <p>Take notice, ſaid he, how things go in that <hi>Star</hi> that's next you. How ſome of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Parts that come fromward the <hi>Poles</hi> of their <hi>Vortex,</hi> mingle themſelves with the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Star, and not being able to keep pace with it in Motion, are thrown out of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46662:119"/>Star; juſt as the ſcummy Parts of a boiling Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor are ſeparated from the other, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Liquor. See how they link themſelves to one another, and by that Union loſe the quality of the <hi>firſt Element,</hi> and take on them that of the <hi>third.</hi> Upon their gathering and condenſing in a very great quantity, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt they muſt hinder the action of the <hi>firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whereby it puſhes the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Element</hi> to the Circumference,<note place="margin">Fig. Seq.</note> and conſequently muſt interrupt that Motion and Preſſure in which <hi>Light</hi> conſiſts. And now you may ſee exactly what thoſe Stains are which you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcover on the Face of the <hi>Sun</hi> of your World.

            <p>Now the wreek and ſcattering of thoſe Stains which are ſtill a gathering, and as eaſily diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, diffuſing it ſelf far and near throughout the Circumference of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> will conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a thin and rarify'd Body, like the <hi>Air</hi> about your <hi>Earth,</hi>

            <p>Whilſt <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> was thus buſied in diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me all his Myſteries, <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> and the <hi>old Gentleman</hi> were diverting themſelves, by Vaulting from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> and were but very ordinary Company to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,</hi> who ſtar'd confuſedly, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly out of Countenance, and who now, and then joyned them, now and then came to us; comprehending not a Syllable all the time, in that Galimauphry of <hi>Vortexes,</hi> of the <hi>first, ſecond and third Element,</hi> of <hi>ragged</hi> and <hi>branched Parts,</hi> &amp;c. for having only <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Ideas they ſaw not ſo much as a Pins Head of all we ſaw in that immenſe Space: And they were much ſurprized to hear us entertain our ſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with ſuch idle Fopperies and <hi>Chimera's;</hi> for ſuch they reckoned all we ſaid, ſo far as to believe we meerly deſigned it to expoſe and banter them; and doubtleſs they had highly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46662:120"/>reſented it, had not <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> foreſtall'd them, by telling them, ſeparate Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd things only in reference to ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ideas they had formerly been poſſeſſed with; and as they ſaw no <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>Space</hi> where we moſt diſtinctly beheld it, ſo he himſelf with all the Eyes in his Head, was never able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>ſubstantial Forms</hi> in <hi>Bodies, abſolute Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> and <hi>intentional Species,</hi> though at the ſame time the Peripateticks talkt of them, as Things they ſaw as clear as the Noon-day.</p>
            <p>Mean time of theſe Occurrences, the <hi>old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> in haſte, came and acquainted <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> That on that Coaſt he had been on, there were three or four <hi>Vortexes</hi> that began to jumble and fall to Loggerheads; and that if he did not ſpeedily come and part them, there needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to tear and ſhatter all his World in pieces.</p>
            <p>Poor honeſt old Gentleman, ſaid <hi>M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> That which makes him ſo ſolicitous for my World, is one of the fineſt <hi>Phenomena's</hi> that can poſſibly be ſeen, and by which I'll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you how <hi>Comets</hi> are begot in <hi>yours;</hi> and how, in time, a <hi>fix'd Star</hi> may become a <hi>Planet.</hi> Let us go and cure him of his Fears.</p>
            <p>When we came there we found <hi>two Stars,</hi> whoſe Surface was almoſt wholly overgrown with Scurf, and whoſe <hi>Vortexes</hi> began to be drain'd and ſuckt up by thoſe round about them. If you have read my <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> and my Treatiſe concerning Light, ſays <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to me, you will eaſily conclude in what this little buſtle and diſorder ought to end; and I ſtrange, ſaid he to the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> you ſhould be frighted at it. Call to mind then what I
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46662:120"/>there teach, how that which preſerves a <hi>Vortex</hi> in the midſt of ſeveral others, is that impulſe caus'd by the Matter of the Star in its attempt to obtain a remove from the Centre towards the Circumference: For the Star, by that Impulſe, puſhing and ſupporting the Matter of its <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> keeps the other Vortexes within their Bounds, and loſes no Ground in the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of its Circuit. For, we muſt conſider all theſe <hi>Vortexes,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Antagonists</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to an Inch, and ſo long as their Forces are equally match'd, gain no Advantage over each other; but as ſoon as one of them is any ways weakned or diſabled, it becomes a Prey to all the reſt, each taking in a part of its Space, and at laſt uſurping it all. Now when a <hi>Star</hi> begins to be over-run with this Scurf, and cruſted with a maſs of the parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> it can no longer puſh with ſo much force as it did before, the Matter of its <hi>Vortex</hi> towards the Circumference; and then the other that ſurround it, and whoſe Matter is indeavouring to get as far as poſſible from its Centre, finding no longer ſo much Motion, nor by conſequence ſo much Reſiſtance, expatiate and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out, and oblige the Matter of that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſht <hi>Vortex,</hi> to circuit along with them, and by little and little each Inrich themſelves. In ſo much, that ſome Moments hence, you ſhall ſee thoſe <hi>Vortexes</hi> increaſe their Circumference with the Spoils of this poor <hi>Vortex,</hi> till at laſt they come to the <hi>Star</hi> it ſelf, which will be made their Sport: That is to ſay, it will deſcend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center of ſome one of thoſe <hi>Vortexes,</hi> there to continue in the quality of a <hi>Planet,</hi> to turn with that Vortex, and to obſerve the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46662:121"/>of the conquering <hi>Star:</hi> Or it will becon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by the Motion that ſhall be given it, to bound from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> and to make a long Pilgrimage in Habit of a <hi>Comet,</hi> until its Cruſts ſhall break: And then perhaps it will recover the eminency of a <hi>Star,</hi> and will take its revenge on ſome other, by appropriating its Vortex to its ſelf.</p>
            <p>We waited then ſome Moments, and ſaw happen what <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had foretold; all the the <hi>Vortex</hi> was drain'd dry, the Matter of one of the neighbouring <hi>Vortexes</hi> ſurrounded the cruſted Star, and influencing it with a violent Motion, carried it clever off: But ſince that Star, by reaſon of its Solidity, that conſiſted partly in its Figure, moſt proper for Motion, partly in the cloſe Connexion of the Parts of the third Element, that cover'd it, and the paucity of its Pores in the Superficies: I ſay, ſince that <hi>Star,</hi> by reaſon of its ſolidity, was capable of a far greater Motion than the Maſs of Celeſtial Matter that incompaſs'd it, and carried it along; having by degrees arriv'd to a mighty Speed, in the turning of a Hand it gain'd the Brink of the Circumference of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and out it flew amain, and continuing its Motion by the <hi>Tangent</hi> of the <hi>Circle</hi> it had begun to deſcribe, paſs'd on to another <hi>Vortex,</hi> and from that to another, till I knew not what became on't: For <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> interrupted the Attention I was in to purſue it, to inſtruct me, That the Adventure I had ſeen at preſent uſually happen'd, and would ſtill from Time to Time in our World: And that what we there call Comets, were nothing elſe but Stars that have loſt their <hi>Vortex</hi> and Light by that congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter, and then paſs'd from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:46662:121"/>becoming viſible to us all the Time they traverſe our <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. Fig. Vort.</note> and ceaſing to be ſeen as ſoon as they entred in another.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Ruin of the <hi>Vortex</hi> I have been ſpeaking of, there were ſeven others that ran the ſame Riſque, and became ſeven Comets. Whereupon <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd: It is not amiſs, in order to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding the Effects that are ſpeedily to follow, to give Names to the Principal Stars that are left: We have ſtill a dozen of them, but we will trouble our Heads at preſent with no more than eight. That then, continued he, pointing out the greateſt <hi>Star</hi> of all, and which had the greateſt <hi>Vortex,</hi> we will call the <hi>Sun;</hi> that other ſhall be <hi>Saturn;</hi> let the next on the Left-hand be <hi>Jupiter;</hi> that on the Right ſhall be named <hi>Mars;</hi> that other wee'll name <hi>Earth;</hi> and the neareſt to us of all ſhall be chriſtned the <hi>Moon:</hi> Of theſe two little ones, the one ſhall be <hi>Venus</hi> and the other <hi>Mercury.</hi> By and by I will name the other four. Having for ſome Time conſider'd the admirable Diſpoſition of all theſe <hi>Vortexes,</hi> that, in ſpite of their Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, did not at all mix and incorporate with one another, a thing no one would believe unleſs he ſaw it, and which cannot be comprehended but by a <hi>Carteſian</hi> Soul; for no other Philoſopher 'till this Day hath been able to conceive it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. We ſaw <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> begin to be overſpread with the riſing Scum, and forthwith the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> with the other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vortexes to get ground prodigiouſly on thoſe two Stars, till at laſt their Heaven or their <hi>Vortex</hi> being entirely ſwallow'd up, they fell in with that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſomewhat near the Centre, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46662:122"/>began to turn about him, floating in the Matter of his <hi>Vortex.</hi> The ſame thing happen'd a little while after to four petty <hi>Stars,</hi> whoſe <hi>Vortexes</hi> border'd upon that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where they were oblig'd to deſcend, and take the ſame Lot therein, as <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in that of <hi>Sol. M. Deſcartes</hi> called theſe four the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> becauſe they repreſent the four <hi>Planets</hi> that turn about <hi>Jupiter</hi> in our World. Laſtly, the <hi>Earth</hi> in like manner made herſelf <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and obliged her to attend her in quality of her <hi>Planet;</hi> for that is the Name which is given to degraded <hi>Stars,</hi> becauſe of their only Employment that is left; which is, to wander in the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> and to turn eternally about thoſe that have rob'd them of their <hi>Vortex.</hi>
            </p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> exemplify'd this Matter by certain <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> we ſometimes ſee in Rivers, whereof one <hi>great</hi> one, that often contains in it many <hi>little</hi> ones, repreſents the great <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> and the <hi>little</hi> ones repreſent the <hi>Vortexes</hi> of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>Earth.</hi> Thoſe little Whirl-pools are carried along by the Motion of the greater, and turn about its Centre, whilſt themſelves make every thing that comes in the Reach of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, ſuppoſe Straws, or little Chips, to turn about their own: Thus the <hi>Earth</hi> carries round the <hi>Moon</hi> in her <hi>Vortex,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites</hi> in <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſeen ſo many fine diverting Sights, and ſo near a Reſemblance of this <hi>little World,</hi> with our <hi>great one,</hi> our Curioſity tempted us to a more particular Enquiry, and thorough In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in all Things that concern'd the Planet repreſenting the Earth, which we inhabit. But <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> told us, That in caſe we would ſee all Things in Order and Succeſſion, as they ſhould be, it would be ſeveral Hours Work to put that <hi>Planet</hi> in the Poſture and Circumſtances our Earth is at preſent in, and beſides we ſhould ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more occur in it than he had obſerv'd, in the <hi>fourth Part</hi> of his <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Formation of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as he at that Time conceiv'd it. Beſides that <hi>Subtil Matter,</hi> whereof it was compos'd, whilſt it was yet a <hi>Star,</hi> which Matter is lodged in the <hi>Centre,</hi> and beſides that <hi>Shell,</hi> infinitely hard,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46662:123"/>that dams it in, I conceiv'd, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> a kind of <hi>third Region,</hi> conſtituted of the Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> not very ſtrictly united: And I yet farther divided that <hi>third Region</hi> into <hi>three Stories,</hi> before I imagin'd to my ſelf the Earth in the Capacity it has at preſent, and in which I am going to put my own.</p>
            <figure>

                  <hi>I</hi> The Centre of the Earth, full of the Matter of the Firſt Element. <hi>M</hi> the internal Shell that covers it. <hi>C</hi> the Place of Metals. <hi>D</hi> Water. <hi>E</hi> Earth, on which we tread. <hi>V</hi> Air.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>The <hi>loweſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Subordinations</hi> was, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Poſition, an Arch of very Solid and Heavy Matter, and there I place the origin of <hi>Metals.</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> which I rang'd above it, was a Liquid Body, conſtituted of the Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> pretty long, very flexible and pliant, as it were little Eels, temper'd with an abundance of the Parts of the <hi>ſecond Element,</hi> which was nothing elſe but what we uſually call <hi>Water.</hi> Laſtly, above all this I ſuppos'd a <hi>third Vault,</hi> made of the moſt clinging and craggy Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> whoſe ſenſible Parts
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46662:124"/>were only Stones, Sand, Clay and Mud, and which was very porous: And this is the outward Surface of the Earth, on part of which tread Mortal Men.</p>
            <p>Next, I explain'd, how in that <hi>upper</hi> Vault of the <hi>Earth,</hi> by its being expos'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Beating of the <hi>two firſt Elements</hi> againſt it, that ruſh'd through its Pores with Violence; there were made a World of Crevices and Chinks, which being in Time inlarg'd by little and little, its ſtructure at laſt, all of a ſudden fail'd, and broke in Pieces; whereupon its Ruins fell in part of the Water below it, of the <hi>ſecond Story,</hi> and forc'd it above them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was leſs weighty; and that's the <hi>Water</hi> which conſtitutes the <hi>Seas.</hi> Some Parts of the Vault were ſtill upheld, and remain'd ſuſpended, as it often happens in the downfal of great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; theſe were not drown'd, and they were theſe that made the <hi>Plains,</hi> and level Parts of the Earth. Laſtly, ſome Pieces, as they fell, were ſhelv'd and ſupported againſt one another, and raiſed above the reſt; and thus came the Inequalities of the Earth, which we call <hi>Mountains.</hi>

            <p>You plainly ſee then, ſaid <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> that to ſhew you the Train of all theſe Things would demand a great deal of Time: But the Hour of your Departure haſtens on, I remit you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to my Book for Satisfaction in all thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. I am going now to make an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all thoſe Motions, and to ſhew you in as little Time as we are ſpeaking on't, this Earth, exactly like yours, with Mountains, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, Plains and Seas. No ſooner ſaid than done: He falls to determining the Motion of an infinite Number of thoſe long and flexible Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> and agitating them, by playing among them the Parts of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> in the ſeveral Places, where he had heap'd them to gether, we ſaw preſently a kind of Sea diffuſe itſelf over the Face of the Earth; it was a leſs Trouble to him to raiſe Mountains, by only amaſſing together an abundance of the <hi>branchy</hi> Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> and cauſing them to link and graple with each other, whereby there ſtood in many Places great and mighty Piles, nothing differing from our <hi>Mountains.</hi> That Earth look'd very bare and naked, without Trees, without Herbs, without Flowers; for to produce all thoſe Things that are the greateſt Ornaments to our Earth, was a Buſineſs that would take up longer Time.</p>
            <p>This done, he employ'd the reſt of the Time that we ſtaid with him, in the conſideration chiefly of two Things: Firſt, of the <hi>Gravity,</hi> or rather of the Motion of Bodies we call Heavy, towards the Centre. And ſecondly, of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flowing</hi> of the Sea. He began with the firſt, and explained it at this rate.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:46662:125"/>
            <p>Take notice, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that this Earth turns upon its <hi>Axis</hi> in its <hi>Vortex;</hi> it has not that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Moving of itſelf, but it is carried about by the Stream of the Celeſtial Matter that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds it, which whirling with a more rapid Motion than the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſpends the overplus in making other Motions in all Parts, and eſpecially in ſqueezing and preſſing Terreſtrial Bodies againſt the Earth; a Preſſure ſo neceſſary, that take it but away the whole Earth would crumble all in Pieces, and all the Men and Animals on the Surface of the Earth of your World would be hurl'd into the Fluid Space, according to my grand Principle of Motion; that every Body that turns circularly, as does the Earth with all that is upon it flies fromward the Centre of its Motion, if not prevented by the other Bodies that keep it in, as does the Preſſion of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Matter.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>And it is for the ſame Reaſon, that a Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Body forc'd into the Air, is oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend towards the Centre of the Earth, becauſe it has leſs Force to digreſs from the Centre than has the Maſs of Air, which it ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to get into its Place: And the Reaſon why it hath leſs Force to digreſs from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is, becauſe it contains much more Matter of the <hi>third Element,</hi> and much leſs of the <hi>ſecond</hi> than the Maſs of Air equal to it in Bigneſs. Now the Matter of the <hi>third Element</hi> is dull and more unactive, and unable to get rid of the Centre, than the Matter of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it muſt therefore deſcend. Your <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Quality, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendi</hi>'s Chains made of link'd <hi>Atoms,</hi> are not worth a Straw, in compariſon of what I ſay, and with that he caſt a Stone on high, to ſhew us by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Truth of what he had been Teaching.</p>

            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:46662:126"/>
            <p>He made us forthwith acknowledge the Truth of all thoſe Principles and Effects that naturally follow them; for upon his placing the <hi>Moon</hi> perpendicular to the <hi>Equator</hi> of the Earth, we immediately ſaw firſt the Sea preſs'd by that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſink lower, and its Waters thus preſs'd and crowded hurry towards the Poles, and ſpread themſelves ſucceſſively on the Shores, proportionably to their Diſtance from the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> 2. The Terreſtrial Globe rowling on his Axle from Weſt to Eaſt, we beheld the Preſſure of the Moon to light on ſeveral Places after one another, according to the Succeſſion of <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> 3. That ſucceſſive Preſſure of the different Parts of the Sea had this neceſſary effect, <hi>viz.</hi> to cauſe it to ſwell and fall in ſeveral Places, according to the plain and evident Rules of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> which gave us a moſt exquiſite and natural Idea of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, conſiſting in this, that by how much it is mounted, by ſo much it is depreſs'd, and as often as it mounts in one Place it is depreſs'd in another; all theſe Motions going on regularly after each other, and being ſet, and punctual, as to Space of Time.</p>
            <p>Again, ſince the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> wherein this little <hi>Moon</hi> muſt neceſſarily be in its Conjunctions and Oppoſitions, was the leaſt of all; and on the contrary, that in which it would be found in its <hi>quadratures</hi> the greateſt, it was evident to us, that the depreſſion and ſinking of the Waters muſt be far greater in the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions</hi> than in the <hi>Quadratures,</hi> and conſequently that the Sea muſt flow with greater impetuoſity and Vehemence towards the Shore, or which is all one, that the Tides be far greater
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46662:127"/>in the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moons than at any other Time, and in the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> than in the <hi>Solſtices,</hi> as it really happens in our World.</p>
            <p>He next obſerv'd to us the particular Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux,</hi> founded on the ſame Principles, and minded us eſpecially of the Reaſon, why we never ſee any Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Lakes and Ponds, let them be never ſo great, unleſs they have ſome Communication with the Sea: For if, ſaid he, thoſe Lakes and Ponds be beyond the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> they are never at all preſs'd by the <hi>Moon;</hi> and for thoſe that are under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> within the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> they take not up a compaſs of Ground, enough to cauſe that one Side of their <hi>Superficies</hi> ſhould be more preſs'd than the other by the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> Now that Inequality of Preſſure is the only cauſe of that Viciſſitude of Motions, which we call the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea.</p>
            <p>I was wonderfully taken with this Explication, and that way of ſolving the Flux and Reflux is ſo handſome, that thoſe that demonſtrate to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> cannot have a <hi>Vortex,</hi> at leaſt an Oval one, ought upon that Conſideration to ſhew themſelves a little merciful to him: <hi>But theſe Philoſophers are a very ungentile and brutiſh ſort of Creatures, and know not what it is to be generous towards their Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mean while all the other Motions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the little World with all poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, <hi>Mercury, Venus, Mars,</hi> and the reſt of the Planets, having once obtain'd their Poſt in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Sun, were extraordinary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to their Courſes.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46662:127"/>with all theſe Prodigies: But we muſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on our Departure, and 'twas high Time we were a going. It was well-nigh four and twenty Hours ſince we left the Earth, and <hi>M.

I made him a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acknowledgment and Reſentment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, aſſuring him of the vaſt Eſteem I had both for his Perſon and Doctrin. I beg'd the Favour of propoſing to him the Scruples that might occur hereafter upon his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I had an Opportunity of ſending a Letter to him. He expreſs'd on his Part a World of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me, exhorted me to a moſt ſincere and hearty Love of Truth, and preſented me with two <hi>Hyperbolical Glaſſes</hi> to make me a Perſpective Glaſs, wherewith, he aſſur'd me, I might ſtand on the Earth, and diſcover all the Curioſities of the <hi>Globe of the Moon,</hi>

He hath demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Dioptricks</hi> the Excellence of that Figure, for the Glaſſes of a <hi>Teleſcope,</hi> beyond all other. He endeavour'd to have them made in <hi>Holland,</hi> and contriv'd an Engine for that Purpoſe, but he could not find Artiſts capable of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſign and his Idea with that Exactneſs as was neceſſary. He brought us on our Way as far as the <hi>ſecond Heaven,</hi> which is that of Stars, and left <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> with us, to conduct us Home.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:46662:128"/>
            <p>Some diſtance from the Stars, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors meeting ſome Philoſophers of their Country and Acquaintance, deſir'd us not to take it amiſs, that they accompanied them, and took their Leave, but indifferently ſatisfied with their <hi>Voyage</hi> and Negotiation. Seeing we were in great haſte, we ſtay'd no where on the Road, and avoided all Harangues and Diſputes with every Perſon whatſoever, though we met in diverſe Places very many Spirits, that would willingly have joyn'd Diſcourſe with us. <hi>Father Merſennus,</hi> as we paſs'd along, made me obſerve the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> and the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the different Elements that compos'd them, and eſpecially the Balls of the ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I had no Apprehenſion of ſo long as I was ſtock'd with <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Notions, but that I ſaw take up the greateſt part of the Univerſe, ſince I was turned <hi>Carteſian.</hi> In leſs than ſix Hours Time we arriv'd at my Houſe, where there fell out a moſt unfortunate Diſaſter; for in pitching with a moſt violent deſcent, and not-conſidering the Glaſſes I had with me, as I paſs'd athwart my Chamber-wall, and my Glaſſes in <hi>Bodily Quality,</hi> could not enter, they were ſtopt, and daſh'd in a thouſand Pieces, by the reaſon of the unaccountable Swiftneſs wherewith they flew againſt the Stones; and thus I was depriv'd of the Pleaſure of making the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had warranted, of ſeeing from our Earth all the Occurrences in the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> as diſtinctly as if I was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally there.</p>
            <p>I found my Body ſomewhat fainty and very feveriſh, by the reaſon of a Faſt of above thirty Hours. Before I entred I would have perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46662:128"/>the little <hi>Negro</hi> to reinſtate my Brain in its <hi>Quondam</hi>-capacity, fearing leſt he had unhing'd ſome <hi>Clock-work</hi> there: For that there muſt be ſomething more than ordinary in that <hi>Machine,</hi> to cauſe ſuch prodigious Alterations in the Soul of Man; and I had been very finely ſerv'd, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been reunited with my Body, I had found my ſelf a Fool; but the little arch <hi>Devil</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> refuſed to do it, telling me withal, That I was highly oblig'd to him, for ſetting me right in my Ideas. I muſt therefore venture on't for better for worſe; ſo that having thankt <hi>Father Merſennus</hi> and my <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> for the favour vouchſaf'd me by their Company in ſo fine a <hi>Voyage,</hi> my Soul entred her Body, and fail'd not in quality of a <hi>Carteſian</hi> Soul, to ſeat her ſelf in the Pineal Gland of my Brain.</p>
            <p>I had requeſted Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> to oblige me ſo far as to ſee me again before he return'd to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s World, that I might convey a Letter of Thanks by him to that great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that had treated me ſo generouſly and gentilely. He promiſed me he would, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly returned at a Months end, which he ſpent partly in the World, in diſpatching ſome Commiſſions of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> partly in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Planets and different Places of the wide Space, which he travers'd in ſearch of ſome old <hi>Carteſians,</hi> on that Philoſopher's Account, to inform them of his Place of Reſidence, and of the grand Deſign he was ready to put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <head>A VOYAGE TO <hi>The World of Carteſius.</hi> PART IV.</head>
            <p>MY <hi>Soul</hi> thus ſeated on the <hi>Pineal Gland</hi> of my Brain, as a <hi>Queen</hi> upon her <hi>Throne,</hi> to conduct and govern all the Motions of the <hi>Machine</hi> of my Body, was extreamly pleas'd with the change of her Ideas; and complimented her ſelf with the honourable new Character of <hi>Carteſian,</hi> wherewith I began to be diſtinguiſht amongſt the Learned. I found my ſelf immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for the Humour and Spirit of that Tribe of Philoſophers; and could not mention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſdain, the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Colleges,</hi> good only, ſaid I, to corrupt the Mind, and fill it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46662:129"/>with empty and confus'd Ideas, and fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to entertain the vanity of a Pedant. <hi>Deſcartes</hi> was the firſt, and indeed the only Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, the World has ever known; the reſt in reſpect of him were mere Children Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Legendaries. Being invited ſome days after to a <hi>Theſis</hi> of Philoſophy, it cannot be imagin'd what Violence it was to me to reſolve to go. I could not forbear gaping all the while I ſtaid, looking down from the exaltation of my Soul, with pity on all I heard. One of the firſt things I did, was the degrading the <hi>Suarez's, Fonſeca's, Smigletius's</hi> and <hi>Goudin's,</hi> &amp;c. in my Library, caſhiering them of the conſiderable Poſt they held, and abandoning them to a mouldy Cheſt of Lumber, there to lye at the Mercy of the Duſt and Vermin, to be ſucceeded by <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> bound in a fine Turky Cover, and all his illuſtrious Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Before my Converſion to <hi>Carteſianiſm,</hi> I was ſo pitiful and Tender-hearted, that I could not ſo much as ſee a Chicken kill'd: But ſince I was once perſuaded that Beaſts were deſtitute both of Knowledg and Senſe, ſcarce a Dog in all the Town, wherein I was, could eſcape me, for the making <hi>Anatomical</hi> Diſſections, wherein I my ſelf was <hi>Operator,</hi> without the leaſt inkling of Compaſſion or Remorſe; as alſo at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſputes and Aſſemblies of the Learn'd, which I thought good to keep at my Houſe, for the inhancing and propagating the Doctrin of my <hi>Maſter</hi> in the Country; the firſt Oration I made before them, was an Invective againſt the Ignorance and Injuſtice of that Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> that caus'd a <hi>Noble Man's</hi> Child to be declar'd for ever Incapacitated from
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46662:130"/>entring on the Publick Government, whom he had obſerv'd take pleaſure in pricking out the Eyes of Jack-Daws, that were given him to play with.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that as reſolv'd a <hi>Carteſian</hi> as I was, I was not inſenſible of ſome weighty Scruples, the more Ingenious ſort rais'd in me, in our Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I perceived alſo that the farther I went, the more they increas'd, and if <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> does not ſettle and compoſe the Fluctuation of my Mind, by a juſt and clever Anſwer to the Letter I have wrote him on that Subject, I have great Fears the Traces of my Brain will change, and the Animal Spirits reſume their wonted Current. This is the Copy of the Letter I ſent to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> that contains the principal of thoſe Difficulties, which I thought not unworthy of the Publick.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot ſufficiently expreſs my Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Honours and Civilities I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from you, during that tranſitory Stay I made in your Parts of the <hi>higheſt Heavens:</hi> The few good Qualities and Accompliſhments, you muſt neceſſarily find in me, prevented not your treating me as a Perſon qualify'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Merit. For you to build an intire World before my Face, and to give your ſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making me comprehend the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, to ſee all the Wheels and Springs of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46662:130"/>ſo admirable a <hi>Machine,</hi> was an Honour greater in its kind, than what the <hi>King</hi> vouchſafes <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, Princes</hi> and mighty <hi>Perſonages,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the Water-works to be plaid for them at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> You may infallibly reckon from that time, that I am devotedly at your Service; and that having made your ſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of my <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding,</hi> by thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated Notices you have communicated, you have yet more irreſiſtibly captivated my <hi>Will,</hi> by thoſe extraordinary Favours you have heap'd upon me.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> who readily condeſcended to the trouble of this Letter, will inform you more at large, both what my real Sentiments are of your Perſon and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. My Behaviour, ſince my return, hath throughly convinc'd him, that there never was a Diſciple more Zealous than my ſelf, for the Honour, Growth and Advancement of the Sect. In leſs than a Month, ſince my Arrival from your World, I have caſt Terror and Confuſion in the Face of <hi>Peripateticiſm</hi> throughout the Land. I have inſpirited with new Life and Courage, thoſe few drooping <hi>Carteſians</hi> that remain'd, but liv'd in Obſcurity and Silence, ſolacing themſelves with the private enjoyment of Truth, but were very remiſs in promoting her Intereſt there, where ſhe had been but ill receiv'd. Twice every Week I hold publick Diſputes at my Houſe, and indeavour therein, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to give Vogue and Reputation to your Doctrin; I have already made ſome Conqueſts among the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> many whereof appear there, and excepting two or three, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governably headſtrong and conceited, they will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46662:131"/>all be my own, as ſoon as I ſhall have anſwer'd ſome pretty ſubſtantial Objections, they have propos'd againſt ſeveral Points of your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. The chief of which reſpect the general <hi>Conſtruction</hi> of your <hi>World.</hi> And whereas in that Affair, they pretend to deſtroy your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions by your own Principles, and ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them are Men of Parts, that give a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and probable turn to their Arguments, in ſo much that I have ſometimes been put to't to find the Fallacy, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to have recourſe unto the Oracle, and that I could do nothing better than conſult <hi>You</hi> your ſelf, as you gave me Permiſſion, and intreat you to communicate your Thoughts, as ſoon as poſſible thereupon. A Voyage from the <hi>third Heaven</hi> to this Place, is no great buſineſs for your little <hi>Moor.</hi> Thus then theſe Gentlemen, to my beſt Remembrance, fell to Work.</p>
                  <p>They began by propoſing two or three trite Arguments, daily made uſe of in the <hi>Desks,</hi> to confute your <hi>System;</hi> and to ſhew that it is a meer <hi>Chymera,</hi> and not to be ſuffered as a ſimple <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſhould they grant the Principles you your ſelf lay down. <hi>M. Deſcartes (ſay they)</hi> ſuppoſes, firſt, That God creates Matter; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That he divides it into infinite little cubical Parts; and laſtly, determining ſeveral great Portions of this Matter, he puts them in a circular Motion, and at once makes the little cubical Parts, of which the great Portions, call'd by him <hi>Vortexes,</hi> are compos'd, to turn about their proper Center. But it is impoſſible, they adjoyn, to conceive the <hi>diviſion</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> of Matter upon his Principles.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:46662:131"/>
                  <p>For as to the <hi>diviſion,</hi> it can be conceiv'd but by one of theſe two ways; either by ſuppoſing betwixt the Parts divided ſome empty Spaces, or imagining thoſe Intervals fill'd up with ſome Bodies or Matter of a different Nature from the Parts. And thus though Nature every where is full, we conceive four Dice laid cloſe to one another, as four diſtinct cubical Bodies; for though there is nothing of a void betwixt them, we yet perceive a little Interval fill'd with Air, that hinders our Conception of them, as of one ſingle Body: But by the Principles of <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,</hi> we can conceive it neither one way nor the other. For we muſt not ſuppoſe a Vacuity betwixt the Parts divided, ſince a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly thrown out of that Syſtem. Nor is it eaſier to conceive a Body of a different Nature, ſince the diſtinction of Bodies, according to the Author of the Syſtem, is not to be conceiv'd, till after the agitation and motion of Matter. That diviſion therefore is an Abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>As to the buſineſs of <hi>Motion,</hi> that's in a worſe Caſe ſtill; for how is it poſſible to conceive that all thoſe cubical Parts, that are univerſally hard, impenetrable and incapable of Compreſſion, ſhould turn about their Center, and break in pieces, unleſs they find or make a <hi>Vacuum?</hi> For the diminutiveneſs of them will not help us out, ſince let them be as little as you can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, they are ſtill hard and impenetrable as Adamant, and all combine together to deſiſt the Motion of each Particular. That <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> therefore is indefenſible, and <hi>Deſcartes</hi> his very firſt Suppoſition is deny'd.</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:46662:132"/>
                  <p>Theſe, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> were the firſt Paſſes theſe Gentlemen made at me, the firſt Blows I was to ward off, in the Defence of the <hi>System of your World.</hi> They had been taken out of the Books of very Ingenious Men; and whereas the Gentlemen, your Diſciples (as if it was their Maxim and their Method, never to be put out of their own Road, which is barely to give an Expoſition and a Proof of their Doctrin) trouble not much their Heads with Objections that are made them, ſince they are not oblig'd to the formal Anſwer of the Desk; theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſs'd for unanſwerable, and ſuch as at the very entrance of Diſpute baffled the <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> But the more impregnable my Adverſaries appear'd in ſo good Accoutrements and Arms, the more my Honour was advanc'd in diſabling and diſarming them.</p>
                  <p>As I had diligently read your Works, and above all, the Book of Principles, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, a <hi>Treatiſe concerning Light,</hi> or <hi>M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> I anſwer'd the firſt Argument, by pleading a falſe Indictment charg'd on you, for making a diſtinction of Inſtants betwixt the <hi>Diviſion</hi> and the <hi>Motion,</hi> as if you had held that God divided the Matter in one Inſtant, and mov'd it another: I ſaid you never ſuppos'd that Matter was divided before its Motion: That the manner of propoſing your Syſtem in the <hi>third Part</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> ſuppos'd no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and that in the <hi>Treatiſe of Light,</hi> where you deſcrib'd the formation of the World, you ſaid poſitively the contrary; advertiſing your Reader, That that Diviſion of Matter conſiſted not in God's ſeparating its Parts, ſo as to leave a Vacuity betwixt them; but that all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46662:132"/>you ſuppos'd God made in them, conſiſted in the diverſity of Motions that he gave, cauſing ſome from the firſt inſtant of their Creation to commence their Motion one way, ſome another; ſo that in this Inſtance Diviſion and Motion were the ſame Thing, or at fartheſt one could not be without the other. That you would be as forward as any of them to confeſs, That nothing was more abſurd, in reference to your other Principles, than to ſuppoſe the Parts of Matter ſtill and in Repoſe, and yet divided, ſince, according to you, the Union of the Parts of a ſolid Body, ſuch as Matter muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd before its Motion, conſiſts in that Reſt they enjoy by one another: And farther, that it was full as eaſie to comprehend how Diviſion was made by Motion, and yet cotemporary with the ſame Motion, as to underſtand how I can tear a Sheet of Paper, by dividing it in two half Sheets, one whereof I hand towards the Eaſt, the other towards the Weſt. I hereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the Books that I had cited, and ſhew'd them the very Places in diſpute: They were convinc'd by plain Matter of Fact, and had no more to urge againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But we had not ſo ſoon done with the Motion of Matter; we muſt neceſſary ſtill diſpute, tho' very calmly, without the leaſt Paſſion or wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſince the generality of thoſe I had to deal with were well bred, honeſt Gentlemen, that would ſubmit to Reaſon. The Queſtion was, to explain, how the Parts of Matter, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo cloſely preſs'd againſt one another, as not the leaſt Interval was left betwixt them, throughout the Maſs, and which we alſo ſuppos'd ſolid, from a ſettl'd Reſt could skip into Motion.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:46662:133"/>
                  <p>After theſe Gentlemen had copiouſly diſcours'd upon the Subject, I ask'd them, If as ſtanch <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi> as they were, they were throughly convinc'd, that the Fluidity of Water, for inſtance, Was an <hi>abſolute Quality,</hi> that when it was congeal'd it became Solid, by an <hi>abſoute Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi> call'd Solidity, and that when it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, it became Liquid by an <hi>abſolute Accident</hi> call'd Fluidity? That one of theſe Accidents made Lead run when heated, and the other ſixed it when it began to cool? And on the contrary, if having read the Delicate Natural and Intelligible Way of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of Fluidity, and the Properties of Fluid Bodies, by the Motion of the inſenſible Parts of thoſe Bodies (a Motion which the meer Diſſolution of Salts in common Water, and of Metals in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> evidently demonſtrates) they were not at leaſt come over to us in that Point? The moſt of them anſwered, That as they were perſuaded there was no doing without <hi>abſolute Qualities,</hi> in the explication of an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Phenomenas,</hi> that which they could moſt eaſily part with was <hi>Fluidity,</hi> and that they would not quarrel with me thereupon.</p>
                  <p>This ſuppos'd <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> Gentlemen, you ſhall be ſpeedily ſatisfied, or more perplex'd than <hi>M. Deſcartes;</hi> for in ſhort, in your own <hi>Syſtem,</hi> the World is full, there's an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> through the whole: Motion, notwithſtanding, both is and does continue, the Senſible and Inſenſible Parts of Bodies are mov'd, nor does their Hardneſs and Impenetrability ſtop their Progreſs. Why may not <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Matter, that is no more impenetrable than yours, enjoy the ſame Priviledg and Charter? Why
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46662:133"/>muſt his Motion be more impoſſible? both you and us ſuppoſe the ſelf ſame Thing, and we have no more to do than defend our ſelves againſt the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who think they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by Motion, the Neceſſity of their little inſenſible Vacuities interſpers'd throughout all Bodies. Their pretended Demonſtration amounts to this; To the end a Body may move, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it diſturb another Body from its Place: That other cannot ſtir, becauſe it has not where to go, if all is full: Therefore Motion will be impoſſible, if there is no Receptacle or a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> On the other Hand, ſuppoſing a <hi>Vacuum</hi> among Bodies, they may be compreſs'd in leſſer Room, and conſequently may make Way for ſuch as preſs againſt them; and thus Motion will be made. This is a meer Fallacy of theirs, which both you and we can eaſily unriddle, by only telling the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> That to conceive how <hi>Motion</hi> is perform'd without a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> we need only underſtand, That a Body is never mov'd alone, but that in the ſame Inſtant one Body quits its Place, another crowds in and takes it: And when I conceive one Body may in the ſame Moment take the Place another Body leaves, I perfectly conceive Motion, for there lies all the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Peripateticks</hi> ſeemed ſurpriz'd to ſee me come over them thus readily, with ſo neat a Concluſion, drawn from a Principle they had ſo freely granted me, and doubtleſs repented them of their Condeſcention: But I proceeded, by telling them, I ſcorned to take an Advantage over them from their Courteſie, though they were oblig'd to it by the Evidence of the Truth, and I was unwilling they ſhould reproach me,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46662:134"/>as perhaps they did already in their Hearts, for having us'd Surprize, and abus'd their good Nature to inſnare them; and therefore I would endeavour by their own Principles to enforce to them, at leaſt the Probability of the Truth I was defending.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> there are Prejudices in the Caſe that we are upon, proceeding from the Imagination more than Reaſon: We imagine, in the firſt Place, That a Body which we fancy in the midſt of the Matter of the World, is far more preſs'd, if we ſuppoſe that Matter Solid, than it would be upon Suppoſition it were Fluid, which is manifeſtly falſe: For if the World be full, whether with Solid Matter or with Fluid, there is neither more nor leſs of it, but an equal Quantity in each Suppoſition; and conſequently its Parts are no more cloſe and crowded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it Hard than if you ſuppoſe it Fluid. Again, we are apt to believe, That a Body, whilſt it is Liquid, is ever ready to give way to the Motion of another Body; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whilſt 'tis Solid, it is incapable of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, if incompaſſed with other Solid Bodies. The firſt is prov'd evidently falſe, by a very common Experiment: Fill a Glaſs Bottle with Water, whoſe Neck is long and ſlender, then turn the Mouth of it downwards, placing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly upright, the Water by its own Weight is forc'd towards the Earth, it meets no other Body in its Way but Air, that is ſtill more Liquid than it ſelf; yet notwithſtanding the Gravity and Propenſity of the Water to put itſelf in Motion, notwithſtanding the Fluidity of the Air that is below it, its Motion is impoſſible, and the Air makes as great an Oppoſition as could
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46662:134"/>a Solid Body, wherewith you ſhould have firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtopt the Orifice of the Bottle: What is it then that thus obſtructs the Motion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? 'Tis the Air and Water's being in ſuch a Situation, as no Tendency or Attempt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of the Water can determine the Air, or any other Body, to come and fill its Place in the ſame inſtant that it leaves it: For as ſoon as it can, that is to ſay, as ſoon as you ſhall incline the Bottle a little Side-ways, and conſequently make Way for a little Line of Air, to wind it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in by the Side of the Water, the Motion will follow proportionably to the Space that the Air ſhall fill. We muſt not then ſuppoſe that a Liquid Body is ever diſpoſed to yield to the Motion of other Bodies: Nor ought we more to imagine, that when a Body is Solid, and ſurrounded with other Solid Bodies, it never is inclinable to be mov'd, which I thus prove.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe an hollow Globe perfectly full, partly with Water, and partly with a vaſt many little ſolid Bodies, of every Make and Figure, diſpers'd all over this Maſs of Water. Let us conceive all theſe Bodies ſettled and at reſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Water fills all the Spaces betwixt theſe little Bodies, we imagine the Parts of this Water of all ſorts of Figures, as are the Spaces which they fill. Thus we conceive in thoſe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces your little <hi>Globes</hi> of Water, little <hi>Triangles,</hi> little <hi>Cubes,</hi> little <hi>Hexagons,</hi> &amp;c. Let us ſuppoſe now, that Water and all thoſe little Bodies put in Motion.</p>
                  <p>Making then Reflection on the Figure of the Parts of this Water, before the Motion, we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive an Alteration in all theſe Figures, in the inſtant of Motion; that is to ſay, the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46662:135"/>little <hi>Globes</hi> of Water are divided in two <hi>half-Globes,</hi> the <hi>Cubes</hi> of Water loſe their <hi>Angles,</hi> and ſo on. Of theſe little Parts, whether Solid or Liquid, ſome receive more Motion, ſome leſs, and briefly all ſo determine one another, as not the leaſt empty Space is left, but upon one's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of a Place another repoſſeſſes it in the very inſtant: And all this is eaſily perform'd by the proneneſs of the watery Parts to break and diſengage themſelves from one another. Thus in the firſt inſtant of the Motion, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there happen'd a Change of inſinite Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; that this Change was made only by the Fraction or Separation of the Parts; that that Fraction was occaſion'd by the Motion, and that the Motion was impoſſible without that Fraction: That the Impulſe that ſerv'd to put theſe Bodies in Motion, was the Cauſe of both the Motion and Fraction: That the Fraction of a Part was cauſed immediately, whether by one of the Solid Bodies, or by another part of the Water; for inſtance, the Angle of a Cube was no otherwiſe ſeparated from the reſt of the Maſs, or any other Part to which it was joyn'd, than by another part that ſlipt in betwixt them both, or ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſeiz'd its Place, as to ſit it to an Hair; and finally that nothing could prevent the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fraction of the Parts, except ſuch a Situation among themſelves, as rendered it impoſſible for one Part to take the Place of another in the Moment of Deſertion; For all being full before the Motion, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the Motion all remain full ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe at preſent, all this Water and all theſe little Bodies reſtated in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in before the Motion: And let
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46662:135"/>us conceive inſtead of the parts of Water, that poſſeſs'd all the Intervals betwixt the ſolid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſome other ſolid Bodies that preciſely take up the ſame Space the Watry parts took up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Or let us only ſuppoſe the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd, but without any diminution or augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its Maſs. Let us farther ſuppoſe, that God made an attempt to move this Matter; and that he indeavour'd at once to divide all its parts exactly in the ſame manner as the parts of Water, whoſe place it fills, were divided in the inſtant of their Motion. I ſuppoſe not any Motion yet, but only an Effort for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, and there's no Contradiction in that Effort: But I maintain, that from that Effort or Attempt, Motion and Fraction muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow: And thus I argue.</p>
                  <p>From that Attempt which I ſuppoſe, Motion and Fraction muſt needs follow, if nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But nothing hinders: For the diſpoſition to Motion and to Fraction is the ſame in this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, wherein I ſuppoſe nothing but <hi>ſolid</hi> Bodies, as it was in the foregoing, wherein I ſuppoſe <hi>liquid</hi> Bodies mixt with <hi>ſolid</hi> ones; and if the repugnancy to Motion and to Fraction, which ſome imagine in the latter, be invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, it would be invincible in the former too.</p>
                  <p>For if in the firſt <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>liquid</hi> Bodies mingled with <hi>ſolid</hi> ones, we imagine the parts ſo crowded and determin'd, as that one going to move another is unable to gain its place, in the ſame inſtant we imagine that the Motion and Fraction of parts can never be: As it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Experiment of the Bottle before mentioned: Becauſe an abſolute fulneſs being
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46662:136"/>ſuppos'd, all the parts combine in the reſiſtance of the Motion of each Particular: But whilſt we conceive the parts of this Matter ſo puſh'd and determin'd, that ſuppoſing one to move, another in the ſame Inſtant takes its place, and another the place of that; thus we conceive Motion and Fraction infallibly muſt follow the Impulſion. But in the ſecond <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>ſolid</hi> Bodies, ſuppoſing God to force and determine the parts of thoſe <hi>Bodies</hi> preciſely in the ſame manner, as the Parts of Water had been determin'd in the firſt <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> at the firſt inſtant of Motion and Fraction; it is plain, that in caſe one move, another muſt inſtantly take its place, ſince it is exactly driven and determined, as the parts of Water was that took that place. Therefore Motion muſt follow in the ſecond <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> as in the firſt.</p>
                  <p>All the difference lyes in this, that the parts of Water being with the greateſt eaſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly divided, but a very inconſiderable force is required to move them; and the parts of ſolid Bodies being more difficult to be divided, a far greater impulſe would be required to do it: But <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> has liberty, if he pleaſes, to ſuppoſe this Infinite; and that reſiſtance which God would find, would not be of all the parts in general, againſt the diviſion of each in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; a reſiſtance we find inſurmountable in Plenitute that's fluid: But would only be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of each part againſt its own Diviſion, which we can moſt diſtinctly conceive not to come up to invincible.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Motion and Diviſion of ſolid Bodies is poſſible <hi>in Pleno,</hi> whilſt we conceive the different parts of theſe ſame Bodies puſh'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46662:136"/>all parts imaginable of the Space, and ſo determin'd that upon one's Deſertion of a place another immediately fills it: For without this Proviſo, Motion is impoſſible even in Fluids, and with it, it is neceſſary though in ſolid Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Although, ſaid I unto them, this Explication ſeems to me a true Demonſtration, yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to recommend it unto you as ſuch. I am ſatisfied if it only ſtaggers your Opinion of the certainty of the contrary Arguments, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made uſe of in this matter; and I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but that after you have conſidered it with Attention, you will grant me more than at preſent I demand.</p>
                  <p>In effect my <hi>Academicks</hi> ſeem'd well enough ſatisfy'd with what I ſaid; ſcarce above one Scruple more ſtuck by them proceeding from a Suppoſal of theirs, that in the firſt Inſtant of diviſion you gave a <hi>cubical</hi> Figure to all the parts of Matter. A Circumſtance that ſtill blunted their Imagination. To this I anſwer'd, that would they but reflect on what I had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to them, they would clearly perceive that Circumſtance made no particular Difficulty; but throughly to diſpoſſeſs them of all uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I aſſur'd them, you never had made that Suppoſition, as your own Words might eaſily convince them; that in your <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> you ſuppoſe no more than this, That all the parts of Matter were not <hi>Spherical;</hi> and that in your Diſcourſe of <hi>Light,</hi> you give them all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figures: I farther ſhew'd them the places, and brought them to confeſs the little Honeſty or Exactneſs of ſome Authors, who thus adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Expoſition of your Doctrin to their Phancy, and the way that lay moſt advantagious
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46662:137"/>to attack you in. Laſtly, in two or three Words I gave them your own Thoughts and Senſe thereupon, which I always took to be the ſame with this, <hi>viz.</hi> That God in the firſt agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and diviſion of Matter, reduc'd it into all kind of Figures, which he forc'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd every way towards all ſides of the Space: That he thereby made a liquid Body; great Portions whereof he after took to move them circularly and make <hi>Vortexes,</hi> wherein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the inſenſible parts that conſtitute them, turn'd round about their Centre; that by this Motion there was made a continual change in the parts of Matter, ſome loſing their Angles, others uniting and linking themſelves to one another. That I, after you, believ'd the ſame thing happen'd every moment among the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts of all liquid Bodies; and thence it was that you infer'd the Exiſtence and Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your three Elements. I flatter my ſelf <hi>Monſieur,</hi> you will not be much diſſatisfy'd at my Anſwers, and that you will acknowledg that how far ſoever I am behind-hand with the reſt of your <hi>Diſciples</hi> in Parts and Penetration, there are but few that exceed me in the Attention you deſire your Readers to bring with them in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring on your Books, and Application requiſite before they paſs their Judgment, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before they venture to oppoſe them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them.</p>
                  <p>But to perſue in giving you the Account of my Conferences: This I have been mentioning had two Effects. The firſt was to break a little our <hi>Peripateticks</hi> of that miſchievous Opinion, they had admitted of your Doctrin, which they had till then regarded as full of Contradictions
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46662:137"/>and Abſurdities, abſolutely incapable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and as a Syſtem that undermin'd it ſelf. The other was, to cauſe two or three of the moſt ſubtil and diſcerning of them, to apply themſelves cloſely to the reading and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Books; whereby they have found Difficulties in earneſt, that ſeem to me to be truly ſo, and upon which, as I at firſt obſerv'd to you, I was forc'd to make my Appeal to you your ſelf. For I muſt confeſs that as Haughty as I was, upon my firſt Succeſs, I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſuch a Maze, as makes your Light and Aſſiſtance neceſſary to extricate me thence.</p>
                  <p>'Tis now a Fortnight that theſe Gentlemen have deſiſted to urge any thing againſt your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; and three or four Conferences in the <hi>Interim</hi> have paſs'd in the explaining your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and reſolving ſome Queſtions they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to me, upon ſeveral particular Paſſages of your Books, of which they thought, at leaſt pretended that they thought, they did not rightly take the meaning. This was only a Stratagem they made uſe of to trapan me. I was well aware of that petty Conſpiracy, which doubtleſs would have given me ſome diſturbance, having to deal with Men of admirable Senſe, had not the goodneſs of the Cauſe I manag'd, bore up my Courage and Reſolution. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, two Days ſince they brav'd it at an high rate; and promiſing or threatning in a ſhort time, to confute the greateſt part of your <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks</hi> and your <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> they told me they would immediately fall aboard the Syſtem of your <hi>Vortexes:</hi> That that was to attack you in the main part; and they queſtion'd not but
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46662:138"/>they had upon that Article, wherewith to ruin your <hi>Phyſicks</hi> to all Intents and Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, whereas they are as Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Obliging, as Ingenuous and Judicious, and beſides were well perſuaded of the difficulty of their Arguments, to ſave me that Perplexity and Confuſion, in the trouble they foreſaw I ſhould be put to, in giving the Solution, they would not oblige me to anſwer them on the place: But were content to give them me in Writing, that I might return my Anſwer at my leiſure: They only read them over to me, to ſee if I comprehended their Senſe; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to you, though I ſeem'd to Vapour, I was extraordinary pleas'd in my Mind, with thoſe little Differences which they paid me: For they argu'd only from Matter of Fact and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples drawn Word for Word out of your Books, which they turn'd one againſt another, and made them deſtroy themſelves in ſo plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and probable a manner, as requir'd <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> himſelf, at leaſt one better skill'd than I am, to refute them. I ſhall tranſcribe the principal things of their <hi>Memoire,</hi> and in their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. They have given it this Title.</p>

               <head>Objections offered a <hi>Carteſian</hi> by ſome <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> againſt the general Syſtem of <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s World.</head>
               <p>FIRST, they pretend to prove that the Poſture and Array in which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> has marſhal'd his Matter, or his three Elements in his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> thwarts and contradicts his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules of Motion, which he gives himſelf, and the Properties he attributes to every of thoſe Elements. And thence they'l draw ſuch Conſequences as intirely overthrow his Doctrin touching the <hi>Nature of Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they will ſhew that his manner of explaining <hi>Light</hi> is no ways conſiſtent with (not to repeat his Poſition of the Elements in the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> but) the very diſpoſition of his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes</hi> amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they will prove, that by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> no more than any other Planet, can be priviledg'd with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Vortex</hi> in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Which being once more Demonſtrated, all <hi>M. Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> is turn'd topſy-turvy, and the whole <hi>O Economie</hi> of his <hi>World</hi> utterly routed and deſtroy'd.</p>
               <div n="1" type="argument">
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:46662:139"/>
                  <head>The firſt Argument.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. We forthwith take for granted, that Maſter-Principle of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> That every Body circularly mov'd conſtantly endeavours to eccentrick it ſelf, and eſcape from the Circle it deſcribes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From that univerſal Principle immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows this particular Conſequence, that in a <hi>Vortex,</hi> where the Matter of the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third <hi>Element</hi> are circularly mov'd, all three endeavour to acquire a Motion eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrick to the <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We infer yet farther, from the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, another Concluſion, That in that general Attempt, made by different Bodies thus agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confus'd, to deviate from the Centre of their Motion, thoſe that are moſt agitated and are moſt fit for <hi>Motion,</hi> thoſe, I ſay, muſt have the advantage and aſcendent over the reſt, to gain the Circumference of the Circle the Vortex deſcribes, and conſequently to compel the leſs agitated, and leſs fit for Motion towards the Centre of the <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this Concluſion ſhould have no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary Connection with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as indeed it has: Yet we might warrant our uſe of it, by producing <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> to vouch the ſame thing, in ſeveral places of his Books, and particularly in his <hi>fourth Part</hi> of the <hi>Book of Principles.</hi> Where he gives the reaſon for the Motion of heavy Bodies towards the Centre by this ſame Propoſition.<note place="margin">Numb. <hi>23.</hi>
                     </note> That it was by vertue of that Principle, that in the Vortex
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46662:139"/>of the Earth, Terreſtrial Bodies are below the Air, and the Air below the Celeſtial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>To theſe we only add one more that <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> frequently repeats, eſpecially in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth Part</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> and in the eighth Chapter of his <hi>Tract of Light,</hi> viz. That the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Element</hi> have much more agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are far more fit for Motion than the <hi>third,</hi> whoſe parts are ragged and branchy, and of a very irregular Figure.</p>
                  <p>All this ſuppos'd, let us agree with <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> that Matter having been created ſuch as he advances, God was able to divide, and actuate it with Motion, and that he effectively has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it and mov'd it. Let us ſtop now, and fix our Imagination and our Thoughts upon that great Partition of Matter, or upon that Vortex, that hath the polar Star for its Centre. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that portion of Matter, made up of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of little inſenſible Parts it ſelf turn'd round, whilſt all the little Parts are alſo turn'd about their proper Centre.</p>
                  <p>From this Motion muſt ariſe the <hi>three Elements,</hi> that is, the moſt exquiſitely ſubtle <hi>duſt</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Element, the <hi>little Balls</hi> of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the <hi>ramous Parts</hi> of the <hi>third,</hi> all which are Parts of the ſame Matter differing from one another meerly by their Figure and their Bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>Whether the <hi>third Element</hi> be cotemporary with the other <hi>two,</hi> as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſeems in ſome meaſure to ſuppoſe in his <hi>Treatiſe of Light:</hi> Or, whether it be form'd by the Conjunction of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of the <hi>first Element</hi> hook'd to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he ſeems to teach in the <hi>Book of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi> That Philoſopher pretends, that in that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46662:140"/>juſtling and concuſſion of Matter, when it hath laſted long enough to break the Angles of moſt of the agitated Parts, the Matter of the <hi>first Element</hi> muſt be poſted in two principal places. Firſt, in the whole Space of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> where it ought to be diſpers'd, to fill exactly all the Intervals found betwixt the Balls of the <hi>ſecond Element,</hi> whereof the whole Subſtance of the <hi>Vortex</hi> or the Heaven is compos'd; Secondly, at the Centre, whither it muſt be forc'd by the Balls of the <hi>ſecond Element</hi> to deſcend, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Spherical and Fluid Body, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Star it ſelf, that by the circular agitation of its Matter, and the ſtruggle that Matter makes to procure its Inlargement from the Centre of its <hi>Vortex,</hi> thruſts the Globules of the <hi>ſecond Element</hi> that is above it, to all Points imaginable, and communicating by their means that Impreſſion to our Eyes, produces in them the ſenſation of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Sum of all <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s fine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin on this Subject. But we offer to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to him, by the aforeſaid Principles, which are all his own, that it is not the Matter of the <hi>first</hi> Element, but the <hi>third</hi> that ought to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortex;</hi> and thus the Stars muſt not be luminous, nor the Sun any more than they, but all muſt be opaque Bodies, as are the Planets, the Earth, and ſolid Maſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of the unactive and almoſt motionleſs Parts of the third Element, entangled and link'd with one another.</p>

                     <head>The Demonſtration.</head>
                     <p>When ſeveral Bodies or Parts of Matter are circularly mov'd together, thoſe which have the leaſt Agitation, and are leaſt diſpos'd for Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the leaſt able to make their eſcape from the <hi>Centre.</hi> And on the contrary, thoſe that have moſt agitation, and are beſt diſpos'd for Motion, are moſt able to make their eſcape, and compel the other downwards to the Centre. This is the third Principle I have ſuppos'd, after having deduced it from <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Matter of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have much more agitation, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly better diſpos'd for Motion than the Matter of the third. This is the fourth Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> conſtantly ſuppoſes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Matter of the <hi>third</hi> Element, not that of the <hi>first,</hi> ought to take up the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the <hi>Vortex.</hi> Which is the Propoſition to be demonſtrated; and is contradictory to that of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> on which he founds his whole Syſtem concerning Light. Therefore the Sun and Stars muſt be dark, not reſplendent Bodies. We charge nothing upon him here, but what is expreſly his own; and we demand at the ſame time by which of his Principles, not knowing what to do with the <hi>Fragments</hi> of the blotches of the Sun, nor what uſe to put them to at the Centre, or near the Centre of the <hi>Vortex</hi> where they are gathered and diſperſed, he makes them wreſt and force themſelves in to the midſt of the Circumference, as branch'd and incapable of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46662:141"/>Motion as they are; and conſtitute a ſort of Air, which, according to him, is extended as far as the Sphere of <hi>Mercury</hi> or farther?<note place="margin">P. <hi>3.</hi> Prin. cip. numb. <hi>100.</hi>
                        </note> How comes it to paſs that the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond</hi> Element, that are either at the Centre or near the Centre, or immediately below theſe broken parts, reſign ſo patiently the right they have by Vertue of their vehement agitation and proneneſs unto Motion, to the place the others get poſſeſſion of towards the Circumference? And if once that irregularity and diſorder, ſo oppoſite to the Laws <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> hath eſtabliſht in his World be tolerated towards the Sun; why muſt a Stone that near our Earth ſhall be caſt into the Air be violently retorted towards the Centre, by the Matter of the ſecond Element below it, under pretence that the Stone hath uſurp'd a place unbefitting its Quality, and only due to the Matter it hath diſplac'd, on account of its vehement Motion?</p>
                     <p>And thus it is that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles agree. Thus he is ſo very frugal as to make them ſerve for ſeveral purpoſes, even for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Concluſions, with the aſſiſtance of ſome little Compariſons he can well enough ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, to the blinding thoſe that read his Works but careleſly, and are commonly deſign'd for nothing but to diſguiſe his <hi>Paralogiſms,</hi> and put off his Propoſitions that Reaſon cannot juſtify.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Argument.</head>
                  <p>In order to comprehend this Difficulty, we muſt ſuppoſe with <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> that all the fix'd Stars are not contain'd in the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſame Sphere, nor equally diſtant from the Centre of the viſible World. That ſome are ſunk deeper in the vaſt Spaces of the Firmament, others dive nearer to the Centre of the World. We muſt alſo remember that each of them have their proper <hi>Vortex,</hi> of which they are themſelves the Centre, and that thoſe <hi>Vortexes</hi> are ſo many different Spheres rang'd above, below, and on the ſides of one another. As for Inſtance, we muſt conceive the Vortex of the Sun, in which floats our Earth, with the other Planets, as a fluid Sphere, ſurrounded with many others like it, which it touches in ſeveral points of its external Superficies, juſt as a Bowl incompaſs'd on every ſide with other Bowls touches them all in different parts of its Circumference.</p>

                  <p>In the third place we muſt recollect <hi>M.

                  <p>We preſume to affirm, That in this Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Vortexes, we who are in <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhould not be able to ſee the <hi>Stars, Monſieur Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

                  <p>Let us add to the preceding Figure, four other <hi>Vortexes,</hi> ſuppoſing them the Vortexes of four Stars that are neareſt to that of the Sun.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Let the Eye, plac'd in the other Figure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Sun, be turn'd towards one of theſe <hi>Vortexes,</hi> to behold, for Inſtance, the Star B. wee'l demonſtrate by <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles, that it is not poſſible to be ſeen.</p>
                  <div type="demonstration">
                     <head>The Demonſtration.</head>
                     <p>The Eye can no ways obtain the ſight of the <hi>Star</hi> B, but by means of the Rays or Lines of the Celeſtial Matter, puſh'd by that Impulſe the Star B. cauſes in ſtrugling to get from the Centre of its <hi>Vortex,</hi> which Impulſe is communicated to the Eye, by its preſſure and concuſſion of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46662:143"/>Strings of the Optick Nerve. But this is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuppoſing the Eye placed in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> And thus we prove it.</p>
                     <p>That Impulſe muſt be communicated to the Eye by one of theſe two ways; either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by a Ray, or Line of Matter drawn from the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi> and Terminating in the Eye; or mediately by a Line of the <hi>Solary Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> in which the Eye is plac'd, retorted on the Eye by the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Star.</hi> As if the Line B, A. of the <hi>Stellary Vortex,</hi> ſhould retort upon the Eye the Line A. C. of the <hi>Solary Vortex.</hi> For it is impoſſible to conceive the <hi>Star</hi> ſhould cauſe any Impreſſion on the Eye but by one of theſe two ways: But neither the one nor the other will ſerve our turn.</p>
                     <p>Not the firſt, becauſe the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> according to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> have each their circumſcrib'd and ſeparate Sphere of activity, and a Motion altogether different. Inſomuch that the Lines of the one are never blended with the Lines of the other: But end ſeverally at the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their own <hi>Vortex;</hi> and if once that Communication or rather Confuſion ſhould be admitted, all would ſpeedily return, into that confus'd and diſorderly Chaos, from which <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> will have his World extracted, by the only Laws of Motion; and farther, ſince there is no point in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> wherein we cannot ſee the <hi>Star,</hi> the Matter of the <hi>Stars Vortex</hi> muſt neceſſarily poſſeſs all the Space of the <hi>Vortex of the Sun;</hi> than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurd.</p>
                     <p>There remains the second way, which will prove as uſeleſs as the former to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> proceeding on his Principles; foraſmuch as with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46662:144"/>him the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> though unequal perhaps in Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt be ever equally matcht in Power and Efficacy. For, ſays he, unleſs there was that equality betwixt them, they would infallibly deſtroy each other. Now that equality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this, that the <hi>Star</hi> of a <hi>Vortex</hi> mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill uniformly round, preſſes the Matter of its Sphere towards the Circumference, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neighbouring <hi>Vortexes</hi> preciſely with ſo much force as the <hi>Stars</hi> of the other <hi>Vortexes</hi> preſs the Matter of their Sphere in oppoſition to it. Which is the reaſon, according to him, that they always maintain their Ground againſt each other: But from hence alſo we manifeſtly conclude, That the Matter of one <hi>Vortex</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of repelling that of another, or cauſing it to recoil towards the Centre, from whence it ſtruggles and contends to move with all its force, reliev'd alſo with the whole <hi>Poſſe</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi> that puſhes it. Therefore that Effort, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a <hi>Star</hi> makes to get farther off the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, can make no Impreſſion on our Eye, ſo long as it is in the <hi>Solary Vortex;</hi> ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of that Impreſſion is utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> that with all its might and main reſiſts it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently hinders that preſſure on the Organ, which is the only cauſe of Sight. To explain our ſelves by a compariſon much like that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made uſe of by <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a blind Man, whoſe Hand ſtirring neither one way nor other, touches the end of a Staff. Let us again ſuppoſe his Hand ſo capacitated and diſpos'd, that for the Perception of the Staff it is not ſufficient that it be immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to it, but that there be beſides that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46662:144"/>ſome preſſure of the Staff againſt the Hand. Let us in the third place ſuppoſe another Hand, puſhing it ſtrongly againſt that of the blind Man. Laſtly, let us ſuppoſe that a third Perſon, holding the Staff in the middle, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to withhold it from the Hand of the blind Man, and that this indeavour be exactly equal to that the ſecond Hand makes the contrary way. In this caſe the Staff will advance neither one way nor other, it will make no preſſure on the Hand of the blind Man, and conſequently, according to the firſt part of the Suppoſition, he will not be ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>Let us apply this to the Caſe in Diſpute: We will imagine a Line of Celeſtial Matter reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Eye to the Circumference of the <hi>Solary Vortex.</hi> The immediate Conjunction of that Line with the Eye is inſufficient to produce
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46662:145"/>the ſenſation of Light, unleſs ſomething more be added. That then which muſt be added, is an impulſe and preſſure of that Line againſt the Eye, which will determine it to ſee; and this is the Doctrin of <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> But now whence comes that preſſure in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> before us? It cannot proceed preciſely from that Line of Celeſtial Matter, ſeeing it makes a directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Attempt, to withdraw it ſelf from the Eye towards the Circumference of the <hi>Solary Vortex.</hi> It muſt then, if at all, proceed from the Line of the neighbouring Star's <hi>Vortex,</hi> that reflects the aforeſaid Line againſt the Eye. But this making as forcible an Attempt to get from, as that to preſs it on the Eye; it is plain, that Effort and Impulſe can no more reach the Eye, than can the Effort of the Hand that puſhes the Staff, arrive to the Hand of the blind Man; and that the Eye admits no preſſion from the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Matter requiſite to cauſe the Perception of Sight: Like as the blind Man's Hand receives no Impreſſion of the Staff, requiſite to excite the Senſe of Feeling, or to cauſe the Perception of the Staff; and conſequently the <hi>Eye,</hi> plac'd in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> will be as far from <hi>ſeeing</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> as the <hi>blind Man</hi> from <hi>feeling</hi> the <hi>Staff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for a Confirmation of all this, we muſt remember, that in the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> not only what interrupts that Effort and that Preſſure, but alſo what ever weakens or curtails one or the other, conſequently fruſtrates the effect of the luminous Object on the Eye; and thus it is that Philoſopher explains the ſpots of the Sun, or thoſe defailures of Light, that appear in ſeveral parts of the Convex of that
<pb facs="tcp:46662:145"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:46662:146"/>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:46662:146"/>Luminary. For, according to him, the parts of the <hi>third</hi> Element, hookt and ingendred with each other on the Surface of the Sun, keep the Matter of the <hi>first</hi> Element, of which the Sun is made, from puſhing the Celeſtial Matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Eye, with ſo much force as formerly: Which is the reaſon that the Lines of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Matter, which touch my Eye, and which we ſuppoſe extended to that Matter of the third Element flak'd upon the Body of the Sun, are no longer Rays of Light, that ſhould repreſent to me that part of the Sun as bright as all the reſt. So that the Light, which I perceive in all the Sun beſides, cauſes me to perceive in that part of the Sun a defect of Light, which we call a Spot or Stain. Now it is evident that this Portion of Matter of the <hi>third Element,</hi> that only floats upon the Surface of the Sun, breaks the force, wherewith the Matter of the Sun puſhes the Celeſtial Matter againſt my Eye, much leſs, than if a force equal to that of the Matter of the Sun ſtood determin'd, and fully bent againſt it, as it happens in this Caſe, where the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Effort of the <hi>Star,</hi> and conſequently hinders it from making any Impreſſion on my Eye. And here let <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> ſhuffle and cut, and make what ſtir he pleaſes to recover his Reader, by an Explication of <hi>Refractions</hi> made in the Rays of the Star, upon their paſſage through the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Sun; his only Deſign is to lurk and ſecure himſelf in that Darkneſs and Obſcurity with which he purpoſely benights the Queſtion. Let him only tell us what he means by thoſe Rays of the Star that arrive to the Earth athwart the Solary Vortex. But what
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46662:147"/>we have ſaid will ſufficiently evidence, how groundleſs and trifling will appear whatever ſhall be urg'd thereupon.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>But if it be impoſſible to conceive the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Effort and Impulſion of a Star, whoſe Vortex immediately borders on the Suns, what will become of the other Stars, whoſe <hi>Vortexes</hi> are infinitely diſtant from that of the Sun, and which muſt make a ſenſible impreſſion on our Eye acroſs a great many <hi>Vortexes,</hi> whoſe Matter is differently mov'd, and are all ſo many Obſtacles to that Communication? Doubtleſs, though all we have been urging amounted not to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> in reſpect of the Stars ſituate near the Sun, it would infallibly, in reſpect of all the other. So that inſtead of thoſe infinite Stars, we ſee ſparkling in the Firmament by night, we ſhould not diſcover an hundred with the beſt Perſpectives.</p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:46662:147"/>
                     <p>What now if we ſhould add it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee the Sun it ſelf? Yet this may be prov'd by the ſame Principles; for no more is requiſite for this, than that the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhould have a particular <hi>Vortex,</hi> whoſe Motion ſhould equalize and reſiſt that of the Celeſtial Matter which the <hi>Sun</hi> puſhes towards our Eyes. But ſo much is true, according to <hi>Deſcartes</hi> himſelf; for he expreſly teaches, That the <hi>Earth</hi> hath a particular <hi>Vortex,</hi> whoſe Matter ſtruggles as much as poſſible from the Centre. That effort is contrary to the effort of the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> on that ſide which is inlightned by the <hi>Sun.</hi> That effort is equal to that of the Matter of the Sun: Otherwiſe the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> would run to ruin. Therefore the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> cannot be communicated to our <hi>Eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Comets,</hi> which are ſeen by the help only of the reflected Rays of the Sun, and that conſequently are not ſo ſtrong as if they were direct? If the <hi>Earth's Vortex,</hi> arguing on <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles, is able to obſtruct the latter, how much eaſier is it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the former, and hinders us from ſeeing all thoſe Stars?</p>
                     <p>All this ſeem'd very difficult; and before we turn'd <hi>Carteſians,</hi> we had a mind to be ſatisfy'd thereupon. But one thing yet remains, and perhaps ſomething better than ordinary, upon the particular <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is Matter of a third Difficulty in us.</p>

                  <head>The third Argument.</head>
                  <p>This third Difficulty is well grounded on <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Principles, and brings ſuch weighty Conſequences againſt the Syſtem of his <hi>World,</hi> as though all the reſt were inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, would alone unravel the fineſt Contexture in it. He ſuppoſes the <hi>Earth</hi> to have a <hi>Vortex</hi> particular to it ſelf in the great <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> A Priviledge alſo he confers on <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but denies the <hi>Moon.</hi> He explains this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in a plain and very familiar way, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying it by thoſe great <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee in Rivers. In the midſt of theſe great <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> there are ſeveral little ones, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Motion of the bigger, and are carryed round their Centre, and at once whirl Chips and Straws about their own. Nothing could be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thought on for the making us underſtand how the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> when carried about the <hi>Sun</hi> by the Matter of the <hi>Grand Solary Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> at the ſame time cauſe the other <hi>Planets</hi> to circuit about themſelves; how the <hi>Moon</hi> is forc'd about the Earth, and four little <hi>Planets</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But as Ill-luck would have it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> by the <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> we found it abſolutely impoſſible.</p>

                     <p>Either the particular <hi>Vortex</hi> attributed to the <hi>Earth</hi> is the ſame with what it had, whilſt yet it was a <hi>Star;</hi> or elſe it is a new one, made ſince the Deſtruction of the other. We maintain that neither the one nor the other can be ſaid. Therefore it can have none at all.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be that it formerly had. For 'tis <hi>M.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46662:149"/>reaſon of the Scum that covers it. Now the <hi>Earth</hi> is a <hi>Star</hi> not only covered with a Scum or Droſs, but with ſeveral thick Cruſts of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Depth. So that it was incapable of preſerving its <hi>Vortex,</hi> which muſt have been quite and clean deſtroy'd, and ſwallow'd up (as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Latin Word expreſſes it) by that of the Sun. Let us ſee then if the Earth was able to procure a new one ſince its removal near the Sun.</p>

                        <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> takes this ſame courſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Thoughts: He makes this Figure which repreſents the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in which the Centre S is the Sun it ſelf. The little Circle or <hi>Ellipſis</hi> deſign'd with C. D. B. A. repreſents the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46662:149"/>little oval Vortex of the Earth which carries the Moon about the Earth T. The Circle N. A. C. Z. is that which the Earth deſcribes in a twelve Months time about the Sun. The Circle B. and the Circle D. bound and terminate the leaſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the <hi>oval Circle</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> Moreover he ſuppoſes that though the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are carried about the <hi>Sun</hi> by the Celeſtial Matter, yet that Matter moves ſwifter than the Planets, as the Water of a River runs ſwifter than the Boats that glide along its Current.</p>
                     <p>From this Suppoſition he concludes, That the Celeſtial Matter ought not only to give the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets a turn about the Sun, but alſo about their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Centres, and ought to form it ſelf into little <hi>Heavens</hi> round about them, that ſhall exactly mimick the motions of the greater.</p>
                     <p>He makes this ſecond Concluſion, That if <hi>two Planets</hi> chance to meet in the ſame Circle, <hi>one</hi> of which is little and conſequently fleeter than the other, the leaſt upon its Approach ought to fall in with the petty Heaven of the bigger and dance along with it an eternal round.

                     <p>He explains his firſt Suppoſition, which is the main Support of all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46662:150"/>Matter which carries the <hi>Planet</hi> round the <hi>Sun</hi> moves far ſwifter than the <hi>Planet.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>I ſay,</hi> this Suppoſition by the <hi>Simily</hi> of a Boat falling down a River, which goes on much ſlower than the Water that flows under it: A plauſible compariſon at firſt ſight, but that has nothing ſolid in it: Since the reaſon of the Boats tardy Motion in reſpect of the Water that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it along, is wanting in the Planet, ſteer'd in the midſt of the Celeſtial Matter. The reaſon is this, that part of the Boat, which ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Water, meets with the oppoſition of the Air, which bends its courſe differently from the Water, and conſequently reſiſts the Motion wherewith the Water influences the Boat. And the greater that reſiſtance is, as in a contrary Wind, the ſlower is the Motion of the Boat, in compariſon with that of the Water. And the leſs the reſiſtance is, as when the Wind ſtands fair, the ſwifter is the motion of the Boat: But this is not to be found in the Planet, plung'd in the midſt of the Celeſtial Matter: It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves intirely all that Motion the Celeſtial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can impreſs upon it, free from all external Oppoſition. Beſides, being of it ſelf indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Motion, or to reſt, to ſuch or ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Motion, to this or that Determination, it offers no reſiſtance, as <hi>M.

                     <p>He gives next the reaſon of that inequality of Motion of the Celeſtial Matter, and of the <hi>Planet</hi> carried by it; which is <hi>(ſays he)</hi> that though ſuch little Bodies, as are the inſenſible parts of the Celeſtial Matter, conſpiring all together to act confederately againſt a great one, may be as prevalent as <hi>that;</hi> notwithſtanding they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46662:150"/>move it in all reſpects ſo ſwift, as they are mov'd themſelves; 'cauſe though they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome of their Motions which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto it, they infallibly diſagree in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which they cannot communicate. Either we are miſtaken, or this is a meer <hi>Gipſy-talk,</hi> at leaſt in relation to the Buſineſs we are upon; and one of theſe Slights of Hand, we have obſerv'd <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> from time to time to make uſe of, deſignedly to blind his Reader, and to conceal from him the Lameneſs and Imperfection of a Concluſion neceſſary to his Syſtem; which he is well aware of, but is unwilling any one elſe ſhould ſee. 'Tis but bringing ſome pretty ſort of Compariſon that may prepare the Mind, and ſooth and tame (if we may ſo ſpeak) the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his Reader, though commonly it never comes up to the ſtreſs of the Difficulty; and then clapping on it for a Confirmation ſome abſtracted Reaſon, that few either can or will take pains to underſtand, and the Buſineſs is done; fore-ſeeing that being half-gain'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by the Compariſon, they will eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render themſelves to the leaſt appearance of Truth, which he ſhall give them a glimpſe of in his reaſon, that often is a meer fallacy at bottom. And as for this before us: What matters it, though the little Bodies, that drive on a great one, ſhould have ſeveral Motions? What tho' they do not communicate all theſe ſeveral Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, provided they have ſtill Strength enought to force it on, that the Body makes no reſiſtance, that they all combine, as we ſuppoſe, with <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> to communicate the Motion requiſite, and that we conceive them all preſſing on its Surface, ſo as to puſh it towards the place where
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46662:151"/>they are puſh'd themſelves? For certainly in all theſe Circumſtances, we muſt conceive it going at as great a rate as they.</p>
                     <p>And yet from a Principle ſo weakly eſtabliſht as this, he concludes, That the Celeſtial Matter ought to move the Planet round its own Centre, and conſtitute a little Heaven about it, to turn at the ſame time as the great one. But not now to controvert that Suppoſition, as poorly prov'd as it is, let us perſue him in his reaſoning; and to ſee if it be good, let us imagine the Earth T. as it were ſuſpended in a Void, and let us fancy a Circle of Celeſtial Matter as thick as the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth, that violently ruſhing like a Torrent, carries it ſuddenly away: But as we ſuppoſe this Torrent to be ſwifter than the Earth, methinks without having puzzled our Heads much with the Rules of the Determinations of Motion, we might readily conceive it, upon its violent daſhing againſt the Earth, to be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately divided in two Parts or Arms, whereof one ſhould run above, the other below it; and whether we conceive this Stream of an equal, or a greater depth, than the Diameter of the Earth, it would diffuſe it ſelf round its Surface, above, below, and on every ſide. Whence it follows, that it would impreſs no Motion on it about its own Centre, but would moreover deprive it of that Motion if it had one; all the Lines of the Torrent counterpoizing one another, and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Determinations they ſhould meet with in the Earth contrary to their own.</p>
                     <p>Here ought to be the foregoing Figure, p. <hi>278.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now methinks in explaining theſe things thus, it is not a bare <hi>Similitude</hi> that we offer, but a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46662:151"/>
                        <hi>perfect Idea</hi> of that which ought to happen in the Motion of the Celeſtial Matter, wherein the <hi>Earth</hi> is carried round the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore then will <hi>Deſcartes</hi> have the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Matter that carries the Earth, and inſiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its Superficies towards A, making greater haſte than the Earth, bend its whole Current from A to B, not ſuffering half of it to run from A to D? For 'tis impoſſible for things to be, or to be conceiv'd otherwiſe. But if it ought to fall out thus, as queſtionleſs it ought, the Earth no longer has a <hi>Vortex;</hi> ſince the Matter flowing from A to D, prevents that which flows from A to B from returning by C. D. Nothing can be more plain and evident than this Demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe <hi>per impoſſibile,</hi> that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when arriv'd at A, ſhould entirely make a double, to run towards B. Would it make a Vortex? No by no means. For advancing from B. to C. and arriving at C. it ought to deviate from the Centre of its Motion, and continue its Progreſs towards Z. The Reaſon given for it in the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> is, That this is the very place in all the little Circle it had begun to deſcribe, where it finds leaſt reſiſtance. Firſt, becauſe the Matter it meets in that ſame Point is already on its Motion towards Z. and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns its place. Secondly, becauſe that which is below it, that is to ſay betwixt D. and C. reſiſts it, and hinders its Deſcent, being more weighty, according to <hi>M. Deſcartes.</hi> And thirdly, becauſe the Circle C Z. is its natural place, according to the ſame <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> It will flow therefore more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Z. than D. and conſequently make no <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us farther ſuppoſe a <hi>Vortex</hi> made, and the Matter continuing its round, from A. to B.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46662:152"/>from B. to C. and from C. to A. would this <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> laſt? Not at all. For we muſt ſuppoſe one of theſe three things: Either that it is ſtronger than the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is, its Matter has a ſtronger bent and tendency from its Centre, than the Matter of the <hi>Sun's Vortex</hi> has from his, or that it is weaker; or that they both are equal. If it is weaker it muſt be deſtroy'd by the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> If ſtronger it muſt ruin his. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then that its Strength be equal with the Suns: And <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> muſt unavoidably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it: But how will he prove it to us, I ſay not by a Demonſtration (we will not put him on ſo hard a Task) but how will he bring the leaſt Conjecture to give this Suppoſition a pretence to probability? Cannot we on the other ſide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſeveral Reaſons to deſtroy this Suppoſition? Cannot we ſhew, in caſe the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> was as ſtrong as that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the little <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules</hi> wreſted themſelves as forcibly from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of their <hi>Vortex,</hi> that the Earth it ſelf would appear a Sun, and ſo would <hi>Jupiter</hi> to boot? Since that which makes the Centre of a <hi>Vortex</hi> to us ſeem luminous, is only the vehement Motion of its Matter? Though <hi>Deſcartes</hi> ſays the Centre would be drain'd of all its Matter, might not we however, imitating the Stile of that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> compare the Vortex of the Sun quite from S. to D. to a vaſt <hi>Ocean,</hi> whoſe boyſtrous Tide ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the Stream of a little <hi>River,</hi> by which we illuſtrate the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it to fall back again, and adds a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its Waters quite contrary to its former? But with <hi>Deſcartes</hi> for a <hi>Vortex</hi> to be deſtroy'd, and for the Matter of the <hi>Vortex</hi> to take the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Determination of another, is one and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46662:152"/>the ſame thing. Let <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> but <hi>prove</hi> his <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> with the leaſt part of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have brought <hi>againſt</hi> it, or by as natural a Compariſon as we have us'd to demonſtrate it a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> and he need not fear to ſtand the Teſt, Sallies and Aſſaults, of the beſt of his Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>What now if we ſhould fall to examining the Difficulties that may be gather'd from the little <hi>Planet</hi> in particular, I mean the <hi>Moon</hi> conſider'd in the petty <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Earth? Should we probably find leſs Matter of Objection?</p>
                     <p>Here ought to be the foregoing Figure, p. <hi>278.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We advance no more than this, that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Moon</hi> when arriv'd at A. was carried on towards B. ſhe ought to deviate from her <hi>Vortex</hi> in C. For firſt, That's the external Superficies of the little <hi>Vortex,</hi> as <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> will not deny. Secondly, She Attempts to leave her Vortex, by his grand Principle of circular Motion. He pretends ſhe cannot make her eſcape towards B. becauſe the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> in that place is more light and active, and repels her towards the Centre. Nor can ſhe, according to him, make downwards towards K. for that, ſays he, the Celeſtial Matter on that ſide is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than the <hi>Moon,</hi> and equally oppoſes her Deſcent: But we ſay ſhe will get out of her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at C. and continue her Progreſs toward Z. For being in C. ſhe finds no reſiſtance, ſince the Matter of C. Z. is that of her own Circle, which is already on its March, and willing to give up its place. Beſides, being in that place, ſhe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally makes an Attempt to get rid of the Centre
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46662:153"/>of her Motion, that is to ſay, of T. ſhe therefore will accompliſh her eſcape, ſince there is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle in that as is found in the other Points; and being caſt out of her Circle, ſhe will be oblig'd to continue her Journy towards Z. by the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plac'd above, and below her in the Circle, for the ſelf-ſame Reaſons as are given by <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet in ſpite of all this, it cannot be deny'd, but that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had good reaſon to order his Suppoſitions of theſe things as he did. His <hi>Syſtem</hi> was too far advanc'd to think of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at ſo ſmall an Obſtacle as a <hi>Moon.</hi> All the <hi>Grandee-Planets</hi> were plac'd ſeverally, according to the Quality and Preeminence their Solidity had given them. <hi>Madam Luna</hi> too was ſeated in the Circle of the <hi>Earth.</hi> There was only one little Inconvenience in the caſe, which was, that ſhe muſt neceſſarily take a turn about the <hi>Earth,</hi> and conſequently muſt be ſometimes in the Earths own Circle, and ſometimes out of it. She muſt therefore have a little <hi>Vortex</hi> of her own. And this is the beſt, as alſo only reaſon that can be given for his making one on purpoſe: And ſetting this aſide, the Laws of <hi>Staticks</hi> alone could never have prevail'd with his Frugality, to put it ſelf to that extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe.</p>
                     <p>We had not inſiſted ſo long upon this Article, had not we conſider'd it as the capital Point in the <hi>Carteſian Syſtem;</hi> and as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that prodigious Edifice, which has been taken in our days by ſo many, for the compleateſt Maſtery of a Human Mind. Let us ſee the Importance of our <hi>Demonstration</hi> by the <hi>Corollaries</hi> drawn from it.</p>

                     <p>The firſt Conſequence belongs to <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of the <hi>Planets.</hi> For firſt of all, there being no ſuch thing as a <hi>Vortex,</hi> the Moon turns no longer round the Earth, ſince, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> the only reaſon of her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiting is the <hi>Vortex</hi> that carries her aloft. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the four <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> muſt be caſhier'd of their Dignity and Employment, which they only injoy on account of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Centry</hi> they keep about him, and that by means of a particular <hi>Vortex</hi> attributed to that Planet, as well as to the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the grand <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> For all that we have ſaid of the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ought to be apply'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and his <hi>garde du Corps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two Particulars in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable enough to aſſure us that the <hi>World of M. Deſcartes</hi> is not that of Gods own making, which we live in, but of a very different Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture and Contrivance.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Conſequence reſpects almoſt all the principal <hi>Phenomena's</hi> of the lower World in general, whereof wee'l only concern our ſelves with the moſt conſiderable and eaſieſt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. 'Tis by the means only of the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> following their <hi>Master,</hi> explain the <hi>gravity</hi> of Bodies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Motion which they have towards the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Earth. For to inſtance, ſay they, when you caſt a Stone up in the Air, it forces below it a Maſs of the <hi>ſecond Element,</hi> and Air equal to its bulk: But that ſame Maſs has a far
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46662:154"/>greater agitation, and is better diſpos'd for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently has more power to ſpring fromward the Centre of its <hi>Vortex</hi> than the Stone that ſcarce contains any thing but the Matter of the <hi>third Element;</hi> and therefore muſt be compell'd by the Matter of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend towards the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> which is to ſay, the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> We may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay then, that without a <hi>Vortex</hi> heavy Bodies would not fall downwards, on the contrary they would naturally fly upwards, and thus we ſhould ſee Miracles and Wonders.</p>
                     <p>According to the new <hi>Syſtem,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> as far out of Gun-ſhot of the <hi>Earth</hi> as he is, could not warrant his own Security, in caſe there ſhould be a People that inrag'd at the heat and ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Rays, ſhould ſometime joyn to give him an innumerable flight of Arrows. For theſe Arrows ſhot from the <hi>Earth,</hi> againſt the Sun, would fall in the circumference of his <hi>Vortex,</hi> and in the midſt of the Matter of the <hi>ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ſtrugling all it can to get farther from the Centre of its Motion, would conſtrain the Bodies leſs capable of Motion than it ſelf, to deſcend towards the <hi>Centre,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Sun.</hi> Now theſe Arrows would be Bodies far leſs capable of Motion than the Matter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Element, therefore it would conſtrain them to fall towards the Sun: Undoubtedly a very ſurprizing thing. And now we may eaſily give a reaſon for the Experiment that <hi>Father Merſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> formerly aſſur'd <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> he had made; that in diſcharging a Muſquet perpendicularly towards the <hi>Zenith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Let. 3. Tom. 2.</note> the Bullet never came down again; for it muſt have infallibly been carried to the <hi>Sun.</hi>

                     <p>According to this Syſtem, when we have a mind to make a <hi>Voyage,</hi> I do not ſay to the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> as did <hi>Cyrano de Bergerac,</hi> but to the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf, it will be the eaſieſt thing to be accompliſh'd of a thouſand. We need but turn our Head perpendicularly towards the <hi>Sun,</hi> then give a little Spring to put our ſelves in Motion, and to make room for the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> that would come bounce againſt the Earth, to give our Heels a hoiſe, and this is all; For, according to the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> it would give us ſuch a flirt, as in a trice would dart us to that <hi>Luminary.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>heavy Bodies</hi> would no longer make towards the <hi>Earth,</hi> but all would be upon the gallop to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What ſhall we ſay of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea; which is one of the choiſeſt places in all <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> Philoſophy, and on which account there's no one but ought to lament the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the <hi>Vortex?</hi> For by the aſſiſtance of that <hi>Vortex, M. Deſcartes</hi> and <hi>M. Rohault</hi> ſpeak Marvels upon that inſearchable <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of Nature. Which not only depends upon the <hi>Vortex</hi> it ſelf, but upon the very <hi>Figure</hi> of it, which was made <hi>oval</hi> on purpoſe, and ſingularly for it, though probably it was not at firſt in the intention of the <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> For never did <hi>Tragick Poet</hi> better and more artificially prepare the <hi>Incidents</hi> of his Piece, than <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> has contriv'd his <hi>Concluſions.</hi> It would ſurprize one to ſee, in his deducing them, that one word, which he let fall careleſs by the way, and one would think without Deſign, ſhould have been big with ſuch an Infinity of Delicate Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. A Man wonders in the third part of his Principles, to ſee the figure of that <hi>Vortex,</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:46662:156"/>which is no better grounded than the Vortex is it ſelf: But when in the fourth he ſees the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> had of it, to explain the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, he cannot chooſe but commend his Foreſight and Precaution. Not but that, for all theſe pretty and ſpecious Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Phenomena of the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Sea, the <hi>Carteſian System</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated falſe in that very Particular. We are convinc'd of this by thoſe Reflections and Obſervations we have drawn from the beſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi> ſince <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s time. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate by the Obſervations of the Diſtances of the <hi>Moon,</hi> determin'd by her apparent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters, that that <hi>Planet</hi> is as remote in many of her <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions,</hi> as in ſome of her <hi>Quadratures,</hi> and as near in ſome of her <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratures,</hi> as in ſeveral <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions.</hi> Hence it is falſe that the <hi>Apogy</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in her <hi>Quadratures,</hi> and the <hi>Perigy</hi> in her <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppoſitions.</hi> Wherefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppos'd that the <hi>Moon</hi> being in <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> is always in the <hi>little</hi> Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Elliptick Vortex,</hi> and in her <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> always in the <hi>Great one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet it is upon this only Suppoſition that <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> explains, and can explain, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Tides in the <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> and in the <hi>Quadratures,</hi> as alſo of thoſe we ſee in the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, if when the <hi>Moon</hi> paſs'd our <hi>Meridian,</hi> the preſſure of the Air was remarkably ſo much ſtronger, than in an other Hour of the Day, it would be perceivable by the ordinary Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Torricellus</hi> his Tube. Yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence has never been obſerv'd, though it muſt be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46662:156"/>very great: We could ſtill give many other weighty Reaſons againſt this Syſtem: But let it be how it will, take away its <hi>Vortex,</hi> and the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> muſt needs follow it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, according to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi> it is the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Matter of this <hi>Vortex,</hi> that having more Motion than is neceſſary to turn in twenty four Hours time about the <hi>Earth,</hi> imploys the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to diffuſe it ſelf all manner of ways, and together with the Matter of the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>first Element</hi> cauſes that great variety of Effects and Bodies which we ſo much wonder at. So the Vortex being ruin'd, all goes to Wreck and Confuſion, and returns to its Native <hi>Chaos.</hi> Wherefore it makes not only for the glory of <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> but for the Intereſt of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to ſave this <hi>Vortex.</hi> For what remains, we proteſt we ſhould be wonderful glad to ſee the Solution of the Difficulties we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd againſt this and the other Points, upon which we ſhall reſign our ſelves intire and ſincere <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to <hi>Carteſianiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in anſwering us let no one think to put upon us, nor quote a place in <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> to convince us he has not contradicted it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when 'tis a plain and notorions Caſe. That Wheedle might take with thoſe that have but perfunctorily read his Works, but muſt ſhew them the Contradiction in a clearer Light, that ſhall take pains to compare the oppoſite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We farther deſire ſuccinct and neater Anſwers, than the generality of thoſe himſelf hath formerly given to thoſe many Objections, propos'd againſt his <hi>Metaphyſicks.</hi> Thoſe very Anſwers raiſe in our Minds more Scruples than they cure: And yet becauſe they have been

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46662:157"/>whereof muſt needs be very tedious, had no more to do, than to refer your Readers to the place, to make them as ill-ſatisfied with you as can be wiſh'd.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>They proceeded farther to ſay, you us'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute <hi>Properties</hi> to your Elements, which you was ſure to take away again when they were not for your purpoſe. They gave me an Inſtance in the Matter of the <hi>first Element:</hi> You attribute as a Property to that Matter a great facility of diviſion and readineſs to change its Figure, ſo as eaſily to inſinuate its ſelf in every place, and ſill all ſort of Space whatever. But when 'tis brought for the Explication of the Nature of the Loadſtone, that Propriety growing diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, <hi>Deſcartes</hi> thinks fit to change it for a contrary. There is occaſion for a <hi>little Vortex</hi> of chamfer'd Matter round the <hi>Earth,</hi> and about each particular Loadſtone, to give a Reaſon for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46662:158"/>the Qualities of that miraculous Stone. Theſe <hi>chamfer'd</hi> parts belong to the <hi>first Element.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Part <hi>3.</hi> princip.</note> It formerly was nothing to them to accommodate themſelves with the Figure of a <hi>Skrew,</hi> to paſs and repaſs betwixt the Globules of the ſecond Element. And now in iſſuing from the <hi>Earth,</hi> or from a <hi>Loadstone,</hi> the parts of Air are able to detain them. Inſtead of breaking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning themſelves to the Figure of the Parts of Air, and ſecond Element mingled with it, they flock and ſettle in heaps about the <hi>Earth</hi> and about the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> where they conſtitute a <hi>Vortex.</hi> Thoſe that enter by the Southern Pole are incapable of paſſing by the Northern, ſince their Figure can no longer be adapted to that Paſſage; and they farther demanded, upon that occaſion, how it was poſſible thoſe Snail-work'd Parts, confin'd and ſtopt thus in a definite Space, having an intricate and confus'd Motion, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt another, approaching the <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Magnet</hi> that was proportion'd to them, could ſo conveniently turn themſelves an end, and preſent ſo cleverly their Point againſt the Pores, in order to their entrance in thoſe Bodies. They pretended the contrary was more likely, and that generally the parts would preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acroſs, and thereby make a Confuſion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſtopping all the reſt, and damming up the Pores of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Magnet,</hi> ſo as to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all thoſe admirable Effects we ſee there. They advanc'd one <hi>Paradox</hi> more, which was a good Humour enough. Hitherto, ſaid they, the moſt rational Philoſophers have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that no Phyſical Argument could be brought againſt <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to prove the Earth was not turn'd about its Centre. But <hi>M. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
                        <pb n="295" facs="tcp:46662:158"/>who ſides with that <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> in his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> has furniſh'd us with a very concluſive one againſt that Motion. His topping Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, That every Body circularly mov'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to wheel off the Centre of its Motion: This Principle is true: He thence concludes, that the <hi>Earth</hi> turning on its <hi>Axle,</hi> would fly in Pieces, unleſs the Bodies, of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, were cloſely preſs'd, and ſqueez'd againſt one another by the Matter of the <hi>ſecond Element.</hi> This Conſequence is moreover evident in his Syſtem: But now let us ſee if that preſſure of the Matter of the ſecond Element is ſtrong enough to overpower the Effort which the Parts of the Earth make to diſengage themſelves and get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their Centre. This difficulty, ſaid they, falls only on <hi>M. Deſcartes:</hi> For the School-Opinion is ſo far from owning ſuch a Propenſity in the parts of the Earth, to deviate from the Centre, as to ſuppoſe a quality and inclination that naturally buckles them unto it. Now upon comparing the preſſure of Terreſtrial Bodies one againſt another, by the Matter of the ſecond Element, with the Effort Terreſtrial Bodies make to get far off the Centre, the Effort muſt ſurmount the preſſure: For the Effort is as great as the Motion that cauſes it, and the Motion is very great indeed, that can carry the Earth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Leagues each Minute; and on the contrary, Experience ſhews there needs but a very little Effort for the conquering the preſſure, ſince no greater is requiſite, than that a Child of four years old imploys in Walking, to lift his Foot and ſeparate it from the Ground, whereto the preſſure of the ſecond Element did faſten it. Wherefore it ſeems to be reaſonably concluded,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46662:159"/>That the Earth turns not on its Axis, ſince if it did, we ſhould all be hurl'd in the Air, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to <hi>M. Deſcartes</hi>'s Principle, which yet at bottom is true in ſound Philoſophy. Thus <hi>this</hi> Syſtem affords an excellent Argument againſt <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Copernicus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They yet farther obſerv'd to me ſome peculiar Places and Points of your Syſtem, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance, which you advance, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, not only ſtript and naked of all Proof, but againſt all Reaſon in the World; they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intreated me to read conſiderately and without prepoſſeſſion, the <hi>ſecond Number</hi> of the <hi>fourth Part</hi> of your <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving explain'd how the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> was deſtroy'd, and how there grew round that cak'd and cruſted <hi>Star,</hi> a ſpacious <hi>Fleece</hi> of Air, you not only plunge it a great depth in the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> but alſo make that Sphere of Air keep pace, and wait upon it thither, and ever incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it as it ſtill deſcends. They pretend that Suppoſition which you throw in <hi>Gratis,</hi> and without all Confirmation, is inconceivable; and yet if it be falſe, it were impoſſible at preſent to have Air about our Earth: It is inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſay they: For, according to <hi>M. Deſcartes,</hi> the Air is nothing but an heap of the Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> exceeding ſmall, and very looſe and diſunited from each other, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary obſequious to the Motions impreſs'd on them by the Globules of the ſecond Element, in which they ſwim. But this being ſo, how comes it to paſs the <hi>Earth,</hi> traverſing thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Spaces quite from its ſetting out, at the brink of the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> to the place in which it is, ſhould ſtill ſo preſerve all. the <hi>Air</hi> about it?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46662:159"/>How by the <hi>Principles</hi> of that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> could that Maſs of Air, being far leſs ſolid than the Maſs of <hi>Earth,</hi> have the ſame Motion, the ſame Determination, and ſame Swiftneſs as the <hi>Earth?</hi> How chance thoſe little Parts ſo looſe and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of each other, and ſo obedient to the Motions of the Celeſtial Matter, have not been diſpers'd by the rapidneſs of that Matter, which they ſtemm'd, as the Duſt is ſcatter'd by the Wind? But added they, how is this Maſs of Air at preſent driven along with the Earth by the Celeſtial Matter? How has it all the ſame Motions? Is it againſt the Body of the Earth, or againſt the Globe of Air the Celeſtial Matter preſſes, to give both one and the other a Diurnal and an Annual Motion? Would not a <hi>Copernical Carteſian</hi> be hard put to't to unperplex himſelf of this Affair?</p>
                     <p>I omit, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> many other Difficulties whoſe Solution probably I may find in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers your Goodneſs will, I hope, vouchſafe the others I have already noted in this Letter. But for what remains, I deſire you to take the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs wherewith I write to you, as an effect of that paſſionate Love you have inſpir'd me with, of Truth, and eſpecially to put a favourable Conſtruction on my meaning. I have only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd your <hi>Adverſaries Memoire</hi> in their own proper Terms and Language, and I preſum'd the reſpect I ow'd you, could not warrant my concealing or diſſembling their inſulting way of arguing.
